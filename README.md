# bb8_core

Home Assistant add-on for controlling Sphero BB-8 via BLE and MQTT.

## Features

- BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) control of Sphero BB-8
- MQTT command and status integration
- Home Assistant add-on compliant (configurable via UI)
- Supports BLE adapter selection and diagnostics
- MQTT Discovery for the following Home Assistant entities:
  - Presence sensor (`bb8/presence`)
  - RSSI sensor (`bb8/rssi`)
  - Power switch (`bb8/command/power`, `bb8/state/power`)

## Release Automation & Workspace Commands

### Automated Release Workflow

This workspace supports a fully automated release workflow for the Home Assistant BB-8 add-on. The following commands are available from the repo root:

### Patch bump + publish + deploy

```
make release-patch
```
* Increments the patch version in `addon/config.yaml` and `addon/Dockerfile`.
* Appends a changelog entry to `addon/CHANGELOG.md`.
* Publishes the `addon/` subtree to the remote repository (idempotent: skips if no changes).
* Deploys the add-on to Home Assistant via SSH and the Core Services API.
* Prints tokens: `BUMP_OK:<version>`, `SUBTREE_PUBLISH_OK:main@<sha>`, and HA deploy tokens (`AUTH_OK`, `CLEAN_RUNTIME_OK`, `DEPLOY_OK`, `VERIFY_OK`, `RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_OK`).

### Minor/major bump + publish + deploy

```
make release-minor
make release-major
```
* Same as above, but increments the minor or major version.

### Explicit version bump + publish + deploy

```
make release VERSION=1.4.2
```
* Sets the version to `1.4.2` (or any valid semver) and runs the full release workflow.

### Manual steps (if needed)

* You can run the individual scripts directly:
   - `ops/release/bump_version.sh <patch|minor|major|x.y.z>` — bump version and update changelog/Dockerfile
   - `ops/workspace/publish_addon_archive.sh` — publish only the `addon/` subtree
   - `ops/release/deploy_ha_over_ssh.sh` — deploy the add-on to Home Assistant

### Acceptance tokens

* The release workflow prints tokens for CI and manual verification:
   - `BUMP_OK:<version>` — version bump succeeded
   - `SUBTREE_PUBLISH_OK:main@<sha>` — subtree publish succeeded
   - `AUTH_OK`, `CLEAN_RUNTIME_OK`, `DEPLOY_OK`, `VERIFY_OK`, `RUNTIME_TOPOLOGY_OK` — Home Assistant deploy and verification steps

### Notes

* All release scripts are located in `ops/release/` and `ops/workspace/`.
* The workflow is idempotent: publishing is skipped if no changes are present in `addon/`.
* Makefile targets are tab-indented and ready for one-command releases.

## Configuration System

- All runtime config is unified via `bb8_core/addon_config.py`, which loads from `/data/options.json`, environment, and YAML, with provenance logging.
- MQTT topics, client IDs, device names, and toggles (e.g., telemetry) are dynamically constructed from config. No hardcoded prefixes remain.
- Telemetry publishing is controlled by `ENABLE_BRIDGE_TELEMETRY` and `ENABLE_SCANNER_TELEMETRY`, both loaded via the config loader.

## Evidence Collection

- Evidence scripts live in `ops/evidence/`, and can be run via Makefile (`make evidence-stp4`). Output is stored in `reports/`.
- See `CHANGELOG.md` for recent config and evidence system changes.

## Development

- Devcontainer support: Open in VS Code for full Python, BLE, and HA add-on development.
- To validate BLE: `docker exec -it <container> python3 /app/test_ble_adapter.py`

## Usage

1. Build and install the add-on in Home Assistant.
2. Configure BLE adapter and MQTT options via the add-on UI.
3. Start the add-on and control BB-8 from Home Assistant automations or MQTT.

### Example Home Assistant Automation (2024.8+ syntax)

```yaml
action:
   - action: mqtt.publish
      data:
         topic: bb8/command/power
         payload: "ON"
```

## BB-8 Add-on End-to-End Startup Flow

1. **Container Startup**
   - S6 supervisor starts the add-on container.
   - `run.sh` is executed as the entrypoint.

2. **Shell Entrypoint (`run.sh`)**
   - Loads config from `/data/options.json`.
   - Exports environment variables for all options (including `BB8_MAC_OVERRIDE`).
   - Prints startup diagnostics and environment.
   - Runs BLE adapter check.
   - Starts the main Python service:
     - `python -m bb8_core.bridge_controller --bb8-mac "$BB8_MAC_OVERRIDE" --scan-seconds "$BB8_SCAN_SECONDS" --rescan-on-fail "$BB8_RESCAN_ON_FAIL" --cache-ttl-hours "$BB8_CACHE_TTL_HOURS"`

3. **Python Entrypoint (`bb8_core/bridge_controller.py`)**
   - Parses CLI/environment for all options.
   - Calls `start_bridge_controller(...)`:
     - Initializes BLE gateway.
     - Instantiates `BLEBridge`.
     - Starts MQTT dispatcher.

4. **MAC Address Handling & Auto-Detect**
   - If a MAC is provided (`--bb8-mac`), it is used directly.
   - If empty/missing, the controller **calls `auto_detect.resolve_bb8_mac()`** to scan/cache/resolve the MAC.
   - Auto-detect logs: scan start, cache hits, discovery result, cache writes.

5. **MQTT Dispatcher**
   - Connects to broker, subscribes to command topics.
   - Publishes availability (`bb8/status`), presence and RSSI (if available).

6. **Runtime**
   - BLE and MQTT events handled by dispatcher and bridge.
   - All actions and errors are logged with structured JSON lines.

## MQTT Library Version Policy
- Runtime dependency: **paho-mqtt >= 2.0, < 3.0** (pinned in `requirements.txt`).
- The code explicitly selects `CallbackAPIVersion.VERSION1` when creating `mqtt.Client(...)`
  to preserve v1 callback signatures while running on paho-mqtt v2.
- If migrating to v2 callbacks later, switch to `CallbackAPIVersion.VERSION2` and update callback
  signatures accordingly.

### Local development quickstart
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
python -m pip install -r addon/requirements.txt -r addon/requirements-dev.txt
pytest -q addon/tests
```

## Logging Setup (Centralized)

- All logging configuration and file handler setup is centralized in `bb8_core/logging_setup.py`.
- The logger (`logger`) from `logging_setup.py` is used throughout all modules, including `main.py` and service entrypoints.
- Only one file handler writes to the log file, as specified by the `log_path` option in `config.yaml` (default: `/data/reports/ha_bb8_addon.log`).
- To log from any module, import the shared logger:

```python
from bb8_core.logging_setup import logger
logger.info("your message")
```
- Do not set up additional file handlers or use `logging.basicConfig` elsewhere; this avoids duplicate log entries and handler conflicts.
- The log file path can be customized via the `log_path` option in `config.yaml`.
- All logs are structured and redact sensitive fields automatically.
