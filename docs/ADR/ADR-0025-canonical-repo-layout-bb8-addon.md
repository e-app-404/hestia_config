# ADR-0025: Canonical repo layout for HA BB-8 add-on (package lives under addon/)

## Context

Historically, a `bb8_core/` package sometimes appeared at the repo root.
That caused:
- import ambiguity (`import bb8_core` resolving to unintended paths),
- IDE/symlink workarounds,
- container/runtime divergence (local vs add-on root).

## Decision

1. **Single, canonical location** for the runtime package:

```
addon/bb8_core/   # package root
```

Root-level `./bb8_core/` is **legacy** and must not exist.

2. **Runtime invocation**
- Set `PYTHONPATH=/work/addon` in the container.
- Launch as `python -m bb8_core` (or the add-on's entry module).

3. **No symlinks** from root → addon. If compatibility is temporarily needed,
use a *shim module* (pure Python re-export) and remove it in the next minor.

## Consequences

- Imports are stable and match container execution.
- Tooling (linters, typecheckers, packagers) sees one source of truth.
- Moves are single-commit `git mv` changes; easier review/blame.

## Implementation notes

- If a root `./bb8_core/` exists, run:

```bash
git mv bb8_core addon/bb8_core
```

- Update Dockerfile/cmd to export `PYTHONPATH=/work/addon` and start with
`python -m bb8_core`.
