# ADR-0005: Development Setup (legacy)

## 1. Editable Install & Test/Coverage Setup

To install the addon in editable mode (so changes to the code are reflected immediately), run:

```sh
pip install -e ./addon
```

For development, testing, and coverage, install dev requirements:

```sh
pip install -r addon/requirements-dev.txt
```

This will link the package defined in `addon/pyproject.toml` for development and ensure pytest/pytest-cov are available.

## 2. Editable Install

To set up the addon in editable mode:

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e addon
pip install -r addon/requirements-dev.txt
```

After this, you can remove the PYTHONPATH line from your `.env` file, as the editable install handles import paths automatically.

## 3. Token Blocks

```yaml
TOKEN_BLOCK:
  accepted: []
  drift: []
```
