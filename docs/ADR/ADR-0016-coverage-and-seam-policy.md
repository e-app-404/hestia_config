# ADR-0016: Coverage & seam policy

## Context
We require reliable coverage without real IO/threads/network. Seams were missing in some modules.

## Decision
- **Coverage**: single driver (`pytest-cov`); repo fail-under ≥70%; high-priority per-file gates ≥90%.
- **Seams**: Do not change production solely for tests. Use local shims via `monkeypatch`/fakes in tests.
- **Network**: No real network in CI. Net tests are conditionally xfailed behind `ALLOW_NETWORK_TESTS=1`.

## Consequences
Deterministic tests; PRs that break gates are rejected.


## Enforcement
- `.coveragerc` at repo root, coverage gate script (`tools/coverage_gate.py`).
- GitHub Actions workflow runs tests + gate on every PR.
