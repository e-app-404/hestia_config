## 1. Context
Accidental mass deletions can cause catastrophic data loss. A pre-push guard is required to block pushes where deletions exceed a safe threshold.

## 2. Decision
- Pre-push hook blocks pushes if deletions exceed 30% of total changes (adds + dels).
- Users must explicitly commit intentional deletions and document them in `reports/mass_deletion_receipt.txt`.
- CI verifies the presence of receipts for any mass-deletion event.

## 3. Rationale
- Prevents accidental data loss and enforces review of destructive changes.
- Ensures traceability and auditability of mass deletions.

## 4. Consequences
- Accidental mass deletions are blocked before reaching remote.
- All intentional mass deletions are documented and auditable.

## 5. Enforcement
- Pre-push hook enforces deletion threshold.
- CI checks for mass-deletion receipts and explicit documentation.

## 6. Machine-Parseable Blocks
```yaml
MACHINE_BLOCK:
  type: mass-deletion-guard
  threshold: 30
  receipt: reports/mass_deletion_receipt.txt
```
