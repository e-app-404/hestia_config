# ADR-0014: Canonical Project Setup for HA-BB8 Addon

## Context

The HA-BB8 repository previously contained multiple Makefiles and developer/CI targets, leading to duplication, override warnings, and inconsistent build/test flows. Supporting files (e.g., coverage gate, bleep runner) were scattered or referenced inconsistently. This ADR establishes a single, canonical Makefile at the repository root, with a forwarding shim in `addon/Makefile`, and anchors the supporting file structure and format.

## Decision

- The root `Makefile` is the authoritative build, test, and CI entrypoint for the repository.
- All developer, CI, and QA targets are defined in the root Makefile.
- The `addon/Makefile` is a forwarding shim, delegating all targets to the root Makefile.
- Supporting files and directories are anchored as follows:
  - `addon/tools/coverage_gate.py`: Coverage enforcement script
  - `addon/tools/__init__.py`: Ensures `addon.tools` is a package
  - `addon/tools/bleep_run.py`: FakeMQTT LED bleep runner
  - `reports/`: All test, coverage, and audit logs
  - `requirements.txt`, `requirements-dev.txt`: Dependency management
- All Makefile variables, file/folder references, and target definitions are up-to-date and consistent.
- Redundant comments, unused variables, and duplicate targets are removed.
- Future addenda may anchor other supporting files (e.g., `pyproject.toml`, `ruff.toml`, `mypy.ini`).

## Consequences

- Eliminates override warnings and build/test confusion.
- Ensures maintainable, future-proof build and test flows.
- Anchors supporting file structure for governance and onboarding.
- Enables future extension for additional configuration files.
