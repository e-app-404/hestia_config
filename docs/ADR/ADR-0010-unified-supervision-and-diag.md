# ADR-0010 — Unified Supervision & DIAG Instrumentation

## Context
The add-on experienced rapid restart loops and low observability due to non-blocking entrypoints, multi-control-plane supervision, and fragile path handling.

## Decision
1. Enforce single control-plane via `run.sh` for both `bb8_core.main` and `bb8_core.echo_responder`.  
2. Emit deterministic DIAG events for runloop attempts, process starts, and child exits; persist to `/data/reports/ha_bb8_addon.log`.  
3. Enable health heartbeats to `/tmp/bb8_heartbeat_main` and `/tmp/bb8_heartbeat_echo` gated by `enable_health_checks`.  
4. Normalize log paths, create parent dirs, and fallback to `/data` then `/tmp`.  
5. Set default restart backoff to 5s; unlimited restarts with manual kill switch `/tmp/bb8_restart_disabled`.

## Consequences
- Rapid restart loops are contained and observable; child death causes recorded respawn.
- Operators obtain clear acceptance signals for liveness and supervision.
- Path handling is consistent with HA volume semantics.


## Rollout
- Patch `run.sh`, service wiring, options schema; ship docs and runbooks.
- Validate via HA host diagnostics (process PIDs, DIAG lines, heartbeats, respawn drill).
