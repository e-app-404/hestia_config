# ADR-0011: Supervisor-only Operations

## Context
On some hosts, docker CLI is unavailable or the add-on container isn’t visible by name. Diagnostics must not rely on `docker exec/ps`. This ADR establishes a Supervisor-only operational mode for the HA-BB8 add-on, ensuring all diagnostics and health checks are accessible via Supervisor logs and the `ha` CLI.

## Decision
All operational visibility is emitted to Supervisor logs (`ha addons logs`). `run.sh` prints DIAG and 15s health summaries to stdout; Python emits heartbeats; an optional file-to-stdout forwarder mirrors key Python lines. All runbooks and operational workflows use the `ha` CLI, avoiding container-internal flags and direct docker access.

## Enforcement
- All diagnostics, health checks, and respawn drills must be verifiable solely from Supervisor logs and the `ha` CLI.
- No operational dependency on `docker exec`, `docker ps`, or direct container shell access.
- Documentation and runbooks must reflect Supervisor-only workflows.
- Automated tests and attestation scripts must parse Supervisor logs for health and DIAG tokens.

## Tokens
- `HEALTH_SUMMARY` — emitted every 15s by run.sh, includes heartbeat ages.
- `RUNLOOP attempt #N` — run.sh emits for each supervised restart.
- `Started bb8_core.main PID=…` — confirms main process start.
- `Started bb8_core.echo_responder PID=…` — confirms echo responder start.
- `Connected to MQTT` / `Subscribed to bb8/echo/cmd` — confirms MQTT event handling.
- All tokens are visible in Supervisor logs via `ha addons logs`.
