# Configuration to address startup performance issues
# Many integrations are blocking Home Assistant initialization

# moved to /config/packages/integrations/logger.yaml

# Reduce startup load by deferring non-critical integrations
# moved to /config/packages/integrations/homeassistant.yaml
#homeassistant:
  # Optimize startup sequence per ADR-0014 memory management
#  safe_mode: false
  # Set reasonable timeouts for startup-blocking integrations (seconds)
#  startup_timeout: 60
  

# Optimization for network_scanner (major startup blocker)
# Following ADR guidance to reduce resource usage
  # Reduce startup impact by limiting scan frequency
  # Original configuration has 116 MAC mappings causing ~21 minute blocking
  #scan_interval: 300  # 5 minutes instead of default (reduces startup load)
  
  # Consider disabling during startup and re-enabling after initialization
  # This prevents the 1305978 second blocking timeout reported in logs
