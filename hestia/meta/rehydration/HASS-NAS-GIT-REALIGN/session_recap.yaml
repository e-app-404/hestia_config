  summary:
    overview: |
      This session focused on making the repository portable for developer machines while
      preserving canonical documentation references to the NAS mount path (/n/ha). The
      approach was conservative: parameterize runtime/editor settings with an environment
      variable (HA_MOUNT), add tracked sample files (.env.sample, .vscode-configs), and
      enforce a validator to prevent reintroducing hard-coded /n/ha in code. Work was
      performed on a feature branch (chore/parameterize-ha-mount) and pushed to origin.
    technical_foundation: |
      Core technologies and choices include Git (local NAS origin + optional tailnet mirror),
      zsh/shell tooling, ripgrep (rg) with grep fallback in scripts, VS Code workspace samples,
      GitHub Actions for CI, and ADR-based governance. Sensitive/editor-specific files
      (.env, .vscode) remain untracked; tracked samples and a validator + CI guard protect
      against regressions.
    codebase_status: |
      Tracked changes include: .env.sample, a hardened validator script (hestia/tools/validators/scan_hardcoded_ha.sh),
      a GitHub Actions workflow to run the validator, workspace samples under .vscode-configs,
      an ADR update (ADR-0016) referencing the samples, and a PR body file. A local pre-commit
      hook was installed (local-only) to run the validator. The feature branch was pushed to origin.
    problem_resolution: |
      Issues encountered (ignored files, legitimate docs references, transient terminal restart)
      were addressed by leaving sensitive files uncommitted while adding tracked samples,
      excluding docs from the validator to avoid false positives, and re-running the final
      verification steps after reconnecting. The validator + CI guard and pre-commit hook
      provide continuous protection.
    progress_tracking: |
      Completed: branch creation and push, validator + CI workflow, .env.sample, VS Code samples,
      ADR note, README, local pre-commit hook (local only), and PR body file. Optional work
      (parameterization sweep across scripts, tracked hook-installer) remains open as separate
      follow-ups.
    active_work_state: |
      The feature branch chore/parameterize-ha-mount is ready for a PR to main. CI is expected
      to run the validator on the PR. A script-sweep plan exists and can be executed on a
      separate throwaway branch if requested.
    recent_operations: |
      Representative commands and outcomes: created a probe that triggered the pre-commit
      validator, validated the guard, created and committed workspace samples and ADR notes,
      installed a local pre-commit hook, and pushed the feature branch to the NAS origin.
      Validator checks reported "OK: no hard-coded /n/ha outside docs" at checkpoints.
    continuation_plan: |
      Immediate recommended action: open a PR from chore/parameterize-ha-mount to main using
      the committed PR body (PR_BODY_chore-parameterize-ha-mount.md). Optional follow-ups:
      run a parameterization sweep on a throwaway branch, or add a tracked installer script
      for the local pre-commit hook.
