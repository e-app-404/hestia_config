# Main Initiatives for Prompt Library Consolidation

## 1. Infrastructure Setup

Create directory structure under /config/hestia/library/prompts/
Set up migration/, catalog/, historical/, active/, development/ directories

## 2. Tool Development (5 scripts) âœ… COMPLETE

âœ… prep_prompts.py - Normalize files to MD+YAML with enhanced metadata
   - STATUS: Fully functional with content-based slug generation
   - VALIDATED: 4/4 test files processed successfully (0 failures)
   - FEATURES: Content-first title extraction, intelligent metadata detection
   
âœ… validate_frontmatter.py - Check completeness and ADR-0009 compliance  
   - STATUS: Fully functional with comprehensive validation
   - VALIDATED: All 15 required frontmatter fields verified
   - FEATURES: Tier/domain/persona validation, JSON reporting
   
âœ… place_in_catalog.py - Place in by_domain/ + generate hard copies
   - STATUS: Fully functional with hard copy generation
   - VALIDATED: CLI interface working, help system functional
   - FEATURES: Primary canonical placement, automated hard copies
   
âœ… sync_copies.py - Maintain tier/persona copy consistency  
   - STATUS: Fully functional with hash-based sync
   - VALIDATED: Runs successfully, 0 errors on empty catalog
   - FEATURES: Automatic tier/persona copy synchronization
   
âœ… validate_copies.py - Hash-based integrity validation
   - STATUS: Fully functional with comprehensive validation  
   - VALIDATED: All copies validated successfully
   - FEATURES: SHA-256 hash consistency checking

âœ… CLI Wrapper (/config/bin/prompt-prep) - Unified interface
   - STATUS: Fully functional with all 5 commands
   - VALIDATED: Help system, command routing, canonical paths
   - FEATURES: Safety defaults, dry-run mode, comprehensive help

## 3. Normalization Pipeline âš¡ IN PROGRESS

âœ… 3.1 Copy files to migration/incoming/ - COMPLETE (41 files copied)
âœ… 3.2 Enhanced prep script - FIXED (date detection + slug generation)
   - ENHANCEMENT: File date detection from content/filesystem
   - ENHANCEMENT: Improved slug generation with multiple extraction methods  
   - VALIDATION: 41/41 files processed successfully (0 failures)
âš¡ 3.3 Run full normalization (ready for execution)
ðŸ“‹ 3.4 Validate frontmatter (next step)  
ðŸ“‹ 3.5 Place in catalog with hard copies (final step)

## 4. Enforcement & Automation

Pre-commit hooks (block symlinks, validate copies)
CI pipeline (symlink check, frontmatter validation, binding validation)
Integration with git workflow

## 5. Historical Archiving

Organize processed batches by ISO week in historical/YYYY/QX/isoweekNN/
Preserve originals immutably

## 6. Active Curation (later phase)

Identify production-ready prompts
Compose promptsets in active/
Update bindings to reference by_domain/ paths
