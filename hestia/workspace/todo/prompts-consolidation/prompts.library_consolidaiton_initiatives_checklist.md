# Main Initiatives for Prompt Library Consolidation

## 1. Infrastructure Setup

Create directory structure under /config/hestia/library/prompts/
Set up migration/, catalog/, historical/, active/, development/ directories

## 2. Tool Development (5 scripts) ✅ COMPLETE

✅ prep_prompts.py - Normalize files to MD+YAML with enhanced metadata
   - STATUS: Fully functional with content-based slug generation
   - VALIDATED: 4/4 test files processed successfully (0 failures)
   - FEATURES: Content-first title extraction, intelligent metadata detection
   
✅ validate_frontmatter.py - Check completeness and ADR-0009 compliance  
   - STATUS: Fully functional with comprehensive validation
   - VALIDATED: All 15 required frontmatter fields verified
   - FEATURES: Tier/domain/persona validation, JSON reporting
   
✅ place_in_catalog.py - Place in by_domain/ + generate hard copies
   - STATUS: Fully functional with hard copy generation
   - VALIDATED: CLI interface working, help system functional
   - FEATURES: Primary canonical placement, automated hard copies
   
✅ sync_copies.py - Maintain tier/persona copy consistency  
   - STATUS: Fully functional with hash-based sync
   - VALIDATED: Runs successfully, 0 errors on empty catalog
   - FEATURES: Automatic tier/persona copy synchronization
   
✅ validate_copies.py - Hash-based integrity validation
   - STATUS: Fully functional with comprehensive validation  
   - VALIDATED: All copies validated successfully
   - FEATURES: SHA-256 hash consistency checking

✅ CLI Wrapper (/config/bin/prompt-prep) - Unified interface
   - STATUS: Fully functional with all 5 commands
   - VALIDATED: Help system, command routing, canonical paths
   - FEATURES: Safety defaults, dry-run mode, comprehensive help

## 3. Normalization Pipeline

Copy files to migration/incoming/
Run prep script (dry-run → manual review 20 files → full run)
Validate frontmatter
Place in catalog with hard copies

## 4. Enforcement & Automation

Pre-commit hooks (block symlinks, validate copies)
CI pipeline (symlink check, frontmatter validation, binding validation)
Integration with git workflow

## 5. Historical Archiving

Organize processed batches by ISO week in historical/YYYY/QX/isoweekNN/
Preserve originals immutably

## 6. Active Curation (later phase)

Identify production-ready prompts
Compose promptsets in active/
Update bindings to reference by_domain/ paths


Critical Path: #2 (Tools) → #3 (Pipeline) → #4 (Enforcement) → #5 (Archive) → #6 (Curation)
