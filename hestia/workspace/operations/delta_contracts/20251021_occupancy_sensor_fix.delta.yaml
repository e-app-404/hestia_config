planned_change: Fix latched Kitchen Occupancy (Beta) and calibrate SNZB-06P
deliverable: Reliable β-layer occupancy signal with proper clear events
action_needed:
  - Replace trigger-based β binary_sensor with state-template (mirrors α) + smoothing
  - Calibrate Z2M options to emit “no_occupancy_since” ticks (optional but recommended)
rationale: Current β remains 'Detected' because only the ON transition is handled
status: ready
path: /config/  # or your HESTIA path for β sensors
RACI_matrix:
  responsible: You
  accountable: Strategos
  consulted: Home Assistant logs
  informed: Stakeholders relying on automations
acceptance_criteria:
  - Beta turns OFF within the configured delay after α = OFF
  - History graph shows alternating Detected/Clear consistent with α
  - 3 consecutive manual tests pass (see Verification)
risk_assessment:
  - low: change is additive & easily reversible
