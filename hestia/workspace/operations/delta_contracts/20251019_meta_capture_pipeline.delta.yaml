planned_change: "Introduce meta-capture processing pipeline (orchestrator + components) with DRY-RUN and governed merge."
deliverable:
  - "CLI tool: /config/hestia/tools/meta_capture/meta_capture.py (periodic + ad-hoc)"
  - "Schemas: intake v1 + APU v1"
  - "Reporter outputs: human summary + JSONL _index"
  - "hestia.toml section: [automation.meta_capture] with routing"
action_needed:
  - "Decide canonical repo root (/config/hestia/config)"
  - "Approve validator secret rules + pin policy"
  - "Approve traffic-light thresholds"
rationale: "Deterministic, safe ingestion of conversational captures into canonical config with audit and rollback."
