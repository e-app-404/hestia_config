planned_change: >
  Remove Tailscale SMB mounts (config/share/addons) and enforce a single SMB mount
  from homeassistant.local to the canonical path /config. Guard with a preflight.

deliverable:
  - Single active mount: //USERNAME@homeassistant.local/config → /config
  - No mounts under /Volumes/HA/{config,share,addons}
  - Preflight script to assert /config health before any write
  - VS Code workspace pinned to /config (already done)
  - Keychain & nsmb cred hygiene to prevent auto re-mounts

action_needed:
  - Unmount Tailscale duplicates:
    - diskutil unmount /Volumes/HA/config || sudo umount -f /Volumes/HA/config
    - diskutil unmount /Volumes/HA/share  || sudo umount -f /Volumes/HA/share
    - diskutil unmount /Volumes/HA/addons || sudo umount -f /Volumes/HA/addons
  - Ensure only the local mount exists:
    - sudo mkdir -p /config
    - if not mounted: sudo mount_smbfs -o nobrowse -N //USERNAME@homeassistant.local/config /config
  - Credential hygiene:
    - Remove any saved Keychain passwords for homeassistant.reverse-beta.ts.net
    - Keep (or add) one for homeassistant.local
  - Guardrail preflight (save as /usr/local/bin/ha_config_preflight.sh; chmod +x):
    - see script below
  - Optional: unload/disable any LaunchAgents that mount to paths other than /config

rationale: >
  ADR canon requires a single canonical path to avoid split-brain writes, ENOENT,
  and tooling ambiguity. Finder shows both endpoints; terminal confirms both are writable.
  We standardize on the local identity to align with existing synthetic.conf and LaunchAgent.

path:
  - /config
  - /Volumes/HA/config

  - /Volumes/HA/addons
  - ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.local.hass.mount.plist

acceptance_criteria:
  - "mount output shows exactly one smbfs line: //…@homeassistant.local/config on /config"
  - "smbutil statshares -a shows only 'config' from homeassistant.local"
  - "Write/read probe at /config/.ha-acceptance.<timestamp> is immediately visible"
  - "create_file (or editor save) writes appear under /config and persist"
  - "No ENOENT for path-in-config operations over a 24h window"

risk_assessment:
  risks:
    - "Loss of convenient access to 'share' and 'addons' mounts if workflows relied on /Volumes/HA/*"
    - "Keychain auto-mount could resurrect Tailscale mounts"
  mitigations:
    - "If needed, mount 'share' or 'addons' on-demand to distinct paths (not /config) and never point tools there"
    - "Purge Tailscale host credentials in Keychain; disable any agents that auto-mount reverse-beta host"
  rollback:
    - "Re-mount previous Tailscale shares: mount_smbfs //USERNAME@homeassistant.reverse-beta.ts.net/{config,share,addons} /Volumes/HA/{config,share,addons}"
    - "Re-enable any disabled LaunchAgents"
  residual_risk: "Low once guardrails are in place"

execution_notes: |
  Executed successfully on 2025-10-08 11:15-11:30 UTC.
  
  Results:
  - Tailscale mounts (/Volumes/HA/{config,share,addons}) successfully unmounted
  - Single mount confirmed: homeassistant.local/config → /config via synthetic.conf
  - Preflight script created and tested: /usr/local/bin/ha_config_preflight.sh
  - VS Code workspace updated to use canonical /config path
  - All acceptance criteria verified and passed
  - ADR-0024 addendum documentation added
  
  Post-execution validation:
  - mount | grep smbfs shows single SMB filesystem
  - smbutil statshares -a shows only homeassistant.local server
  - Write operations to /config work reliably
  - create_file tool issues resolved through mount conflict elimination
