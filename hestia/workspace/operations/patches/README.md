Operations patches directory
===========================

This directory stores patches and operational artifacts that are intended to be kept in the repository (as opposed to ephemeral cache files). Use this directory for persistent patch notes, migration artifacts, and official patch records.

Conventions
-----------
- `hestia/workspace/operations/patches/` is the canonical home for patches and migration artifacts.
- Files here should be reviewed and committed via PR like any other repo change.
- Do not add files from `hestia/workspace/cache/patches/` directly; instead, migrate them using the workspace migration flow which deletes the cache copy after successful migration.

Migration flow
--------------
1. Place generated patches in `hestia/workspace/cache/patches/` during creation.
2. When ready to keep them, run the migration tool (or ask the agent) to move files into `hestia/workspace/operations/patches/` and delete the cache originals.
3. Commit the changes.
