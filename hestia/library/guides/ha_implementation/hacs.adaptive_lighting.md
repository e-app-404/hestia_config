# Adaptive Lighting (HACS) Integration

> Adaptive Lighting is a custom component for Home Assistant that intelligently adjusts the brightness and color of your lights based on the sun's position, while still allowing for manual control. Adaptive Lighting also offers a "sleep mode" which sets your lights to minimal brightness and a very warm color, perfect for winding down at night.

## Features

When initially turning on a light that is controlled by Adaptive Lighting, the `light.turn_on` service call is intercepted, and the light's brightness and color are automatically adjusted based on the sun's position. After that, the light's brightness and color are automatically adjusted at a regular interval.

### Switch Entities

Adaptive Lighting provides four switches (using "living_room" as an example component name):

- **`switch.adaptive_lighting_living_room`** - Turn Adaptive Lighting on or off and view current light settings through its attributes
- **`switch.adaptive_lighting_sleep_mode_living_room`** - Activate "sleep mode" and set custom `sleep_brightness` and `sleep_color_temp`
- **`switch.adaptive_lighting_adapt_brightness_living_room`** - Enable or disable brightness adaptation for supported lights
- **`switch.adaptive_lighting_adapt_color_living_room`** - Enable or disable color adaptation for supported lights
## Manual Control

Adaptive Lighting is designed to automatically detect when you or another source (e.g., automation) manually changes light settings. When this occurs, the affected light is marked as "manually controlled," and Adaptive Lighting will not make further adjustments until the light is turned off and back on or reset using the `adaptive_lighting.set_manual_control` service call. This feature is available when `take_over_control` is enabled.

Additionally, enabling `detect_non_ha_changes` allows Adaptive Lighting to detect all state changes, including those made outside of Home Assistant, by comparing the light's state to its previously used settings. The `adaptive_lighting.manual_control` event is fired when a light is marked as "manually controlled," allowing for integration with automations.

> **⚠️ Caution**: Some lights might falsely indicate an 'on' state, which could result in lights turning on unexpectedly. Disable `detect_non_ha_changes` if you encounter such issues.

## Configuration

Adaptive Lighting supports configuration through both YAML and the frontend (Settings → Devices and Services → Adaptive Lighting → Options), with identical option names in both methods.

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
adaptive_lighting:
  lights:
    - light.living_room_lights
```

> **Note**: If you plan to strictly use the UI, the `adaptive_lighting:` entry must still be added to the YAML.

Minimizes network traffic and improves the adaptation responsivity in some situations. Disable if physical light states get out of sync with HA's recorded state | `False` | bool |
| `intercept` | Intercept and adapt light.turn_on calls to enabling instantaneous color and brightness adaptation. Disable for lights that do not support light.turn_on with color and brightness | `True` | bool |
| `multi_light_intercept` | Intercept and adapt light.turn_on calls that target multiple lights. **⚠️** This might result in splitting up a single light.turn_on call into multiple calls, e.g., when lights are in different switches. Requires intercept to be enabled | `True` | bool |
| `include_config_in_attributes` | Show all options as attributes on the switch in Home Assistant when set to true | `False` | bool |

- [Toggle multiple Adaptive Lighting switches to "sleep mode" using an input_boolean.sleep_mode](https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting#automation-examples)

## Additional Information

For more details on adding the integration and setting options, refer to the [documentation of the PR](https://github.com/basnijholt/adaptive-lighting) and this [video tutorial on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeassistant/).

Adaptive Lighting was initially inspired by [@claytonjn's hass-circadian_lighting](https://github.com/claytonjn/hass-circadian_lighting), but has since been entirely rewritten and expanded with new features.

## Troubleshooting

Encountering issues? Enable debug logging in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.adaptive_lighting: debug
```

After the issue occurs, create a new issue report with the log (`/config/home-assistant.log`).

### Common Problems & Solutions

#### Lights Not Responding or Turning On by Themselves

Adaptive Lighting sends more commands to lights than a typical human user would. If your light control network is unhealthy, you may experience:

- Laggy manual commands (e.g., turning lights on or off)
- Unresponsive lights  
- Home Assistant reporting incorrect light states, causing Adaptive Lighting to inadvertently turn lights back on

Most issues that appear to be caused by Adaptive Lighting are actually due to unrelated problems. Addressing these issues will significantly improve your Home Assistant experience.

In case lights are suddenly turning on by themselves, this is most likely due to the light incorrectly reporting an "on" state to Home Assistant, leading to an undesired Adaptive Lighting action. To prevent adapting in cases where the state of the light is suddenly "on" and only adapt if there is an associated `light.turn_on` service call, set `detect_non_ha_changes: false`.

### Network Issues

#### WiFi Networks

Ensure your light bulbs have a strong WiFi connection. If the signal strength is less than -70dBm, the connection may be weak and prone to dropping messages.

#### Zigbee, Z-Wave, and Other Mesh Networks
Mesh networks typically require powered devices to act as routers, relaying messages back to the central coordinator (the radio connected to Home Assistant). Philips lights usually function as routers, while Ikea, Sengled, and generic Tuya bulbs often do not. If devices become unresponsive or fail to respond to commands, Adaptive Lighting can exacerbate the issue. Use network maps (available in ZHA, zigbee2mqtt, deCONZ, and ZWaveJS UI) to evaluate your network health. Smart plugs can be an affordable way to add more routers to your network.

For most Zigbee networks, using groups is essential for optimal performance. For example, if you want to use Adaptive Lighting in a hallway with six bulbs, adding each bulb individually to the Adaptive Lighting configuration could overwhelm the network with commands. Instead, create a group in your Zigbee software (not a regular Home Assistant group) and add that single group to the Adaptive Lighting configuration. This sends a single broadcast command to adjust all bulbs, improving response times and keeping the bulbs in sync.

As a rule of thumb, if you always control lights together (e.g., bulbs in a ceiling fixture), they should be in a Zigbee group. Expose only the group (not individual bulbs) in Home Assistant Dashboards and external systems like Google Home or Apple HomeKit.

> **⚠️ Warning**: If you control lights individually, manual_control cannot behave correctly! If you need to control lights individually as well, use a Home Assistant Light Group.

### Light Color Matching Issues

Bulbs from different manufacturers or models may have varying color temperature specifications. For instance, if you have two Adaptive Lighting configurations—one with only Philips Hue White Ambiance bulbs and another with a mix of Philips Hue White Ambiance and Sengled bulbs—the Philips Hue bulbs may appear to have different color temperatures despite having identical settings.

*Warning*: If you control lights individually, manual_control cannot behave correctly! If you need to control lights individually as well, use a Home Assistant Light Group.

:rainbow: Light Colors Not Matching
Bulbs from different manufacturers or models may have varying color temperature specifications. For instance, if you have two Adaptive Lighting configurations—one with only Philips Hue White Ambiance bulbs and another with a mix of Philips Hue White Ambiance and Sengled bulbs—the Philips Hue bulbs may appear to have different color temperatures despite having identical settings.

To resolve this:

- Include only bulbs of the same make and model in a single Adaptive Lighting configuration
- Rearrange bulbs so that different color temperatures are not visible simultaneously

### Light-Specific Issues

These lights are known to exhibit disadvantageous behaviour due to firmware bugs, insufficient functionality, or hardware limitations:

#### Sengled Z01-A19NAE26

- **Unexpected turn-ons**: If Adaptive Lighting sends a long transition time (like the default 45 seconds), and the bulb is turned off during that time, it may turn back on after approximately 10 seconds to continue the transition command. Since the bulb is turning itself on, there will be no obvious trigger in Home Assistant or other logs indicating the cause of the light turning on. To fix this, set a much shorter transition time, such as 1 second.
- **Heat sensitivity**: Additionally, these bulbs may perform poorly in enclosed "dome" style ceiling lights, particularly when hot. While most LEDs (even non-smart ones) state in the fine print that they do not support working in enclosed fixtures, in practice, more expensive bulbs like Philips Hue generally perform better. To resolve this issue, move the problematic bulbs to open-air fixtures.

#### Ikea Tradfri bulbs/drivers (and related Ikea smart light products)

- **Unsupported simultaneous transition of brightness and color**: When receiving such a command, they switch the brightness instantly and only transition the color. To get smooth transitions of both brightness and color, enable `separate_turn_on_commands`.
- **Unresponsiveness during color transitions**: No other commands are processed during an ongoing color transition, e.g., turn-off commands are ignored and lights stay on despite being reported as off to Home Assistant. The default config with long transitions thus results in long periods of unresponsiveness. To work around this, disable transitions by setting `transition` to 0, and increase the adaptation frequency by setting `interval` to a short time, e.g., 15 seconds, to retain the impression of smooth continuous adaptations. Keeping the `initial_transition` is recommended for a smooth fade-in (lights are usually not turned off momentarily after being turned on, in which case a short period of unresponsiveness is tolerable).
