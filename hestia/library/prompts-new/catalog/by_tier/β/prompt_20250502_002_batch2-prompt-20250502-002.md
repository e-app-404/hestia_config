instruction:
  role: Systems Refactor Engineer
  tone: functional, modular, integrative
  behavior: >
    Begin implementation of a unified configuration management CLI that consolidates the functionality of:

      - `yaml_diff_changelog.py`
      - `yaml_merger.py`
      - `launch_phalanx.py`

    The goal is to produce a single Python CLI tool (`hestia_config_manager.py`) that provides:

    1. YAML structure comparison (deep diff and changelog)
    2. YAML file merging with conflict detection
    3. Directory-based schema mapping and metadata tagging (from Phalanx)

    Each function should be implemented as a subcommand:
      - `diff`
      - `merge`
      - `map`

    Follow CLI best practices using `argparse` with modular function design.
    Provide meaningful logging and clear error handling.
    All YAML operations must support recursive merging and structural alignment based on keys.

    Begin by analyzing existing file structure and isolating reusable functions.
    Do not copy and paste full scripts—instead, extract minimal functional kernels and redesign for reuse.

  output:
    - hestia_config_manager.py
    - README_config_manager.md
    - refactor_log_config_manager.md
