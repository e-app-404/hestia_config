**🛠️ Developer Instruction: Hestia System Documentation**

You’ve been the sole developer of Hestia—a highly modular, deeply integrated system—and now the time has come to bring junior developers into the fold. Your task is to create a set of onboarding documentation that bridges the gap between *how Hestia works* and *why it was built this way*.

This documentation should serve not only as a technical reference but also as a **narrative-driven architectural overview**. It should walk the reader from high-level concepts down to the specific structural and modular components that power the system.

### 📚 Objectives:

- **Explain the Hestia system conceptually**: What is it? What problem does it solve? What philosophy guides its development?
- **Describe the system's architecture**: Break down how Hestia is organized into structural layers, subsystems, and packages. Describe how these layers interact and flow together.
- **Detail major components**: For each major feature or system (e.g., presence detection, energy monitoring, abstraction layers), provide:
  - A descriptive overview of its purpose.
  - The reasoning behind its structure and the design decisions involved.
  - The specific Home Assistant or ESPHome mechanisms it leverages.

### 🧠 Tone & Depth:

- Be **technically rich and accurate**—this is not marketing copy.
- Prioritize **clarity** for junior developers, without oversimplifying.
- Use **storytelling** to communicate the rationale behind decisions (e.g., "We chose modular packages here to support override layers in future deployments…").
- Avoid turning foundational design documents into static truth—acknowledge where older documents are helpful but no longer definitive.
- Include **illustrative examples**, especially where Jinja2, YAML structure, or package organization could confuse newcomers.

### ✅ Deliverables:

- A structured, readable onboarding document or guide (Markdown preferred).
- Clear headings for: concept, architecture, subsystems, components, rationale, examples.
- Optional: Include diagrams, file structure trees, or example snippets where it aids understanding.

# 🏗️ Hestia System: Onboarding & Architecture Guide

Welcome to the Hestia system! This document will guide you through the core concepts, architectural structure, major subsystems, and rationale behind Hestia’s design. Whether you're a new contributor or just need a refresher, this is your foundational guide.

---

## 🔍 1. Conceptual Overview

### What is Hestia?
_A concise description of Hestia’s purpose, the problems it solves, and the philosophy driving it._

### Why Hestia Exists
_A short narrative: what inspired its creation? What makes it different from other setups or platforms?_

---

## 🧱 2. Architectural Structure

### Layers of Hestia
_Describe the high-level architectural layers: abstraction → logic → automation → interface._

### Files & Modularity
_Explain how configuration files are organized: packages, folders, override layers, metadata tags._

### Key Design Principles
- Modularity & Reuse
- Decoupled logic
- Template abstraction
- Subsystem encapsulation

---

## 🧩 3. Subsystems

Each subsystem should have:

### Subsystem Name (e.g., Presence Detection)
- **Purpose**: What does it do?
- **Key Entities**: Sensors, binary sensors, helpers involved
- **Architecture**: Where it lives in the file structure
- **Design Story**: Why this subsystem was architected the way it is
- **Best Practices**: Gotchas, legacy decisions, and current recommendations

(Repeat this format for each major subsystem.)

---

## 🧬 4. Component Deep-Dives

### Component: `sensor.presence_abstraction_layer`
- **Function**: Describe its role
- **Defined In**: `/config/hestia/packages/hermes/home_presence_abstraction.yaml`
- **Key Attributes**: What attributes does it expose?
- **Used By**: List any other sensors/automations that depend on it

(Repeat for all foundational components.)

---

## 🧠 5. Templating Logic

### Jinja2 in Hestia
_Explain templating roles, value vs. attribute templates, structure, best practices._

```jinja2
{% set threshold = states('input_number.presence_threshold') | float(50) %}
{% set person = state_attr('sensor.presence_abstraction_layer', 'person_tracker') %}
```

### Examples
- Confidence scoring
- Dynamic detection methods
- Device abstraction

---

## 📂 6. File Structure Overview

```
/config/
├── hestia/
│   ├── core/
│   ├── packages/
│   │   └── hermes/
│   ├── overrides/
│   ├── shared/
│   └── metadata/
```

- **Describe each folder**: what lives there, and why.
- Highlight how includes (`!include`, `!include_dir_merge_named`, etc.) are used.

---

## 📝 7. Legacy Notes

### What to Keep in Mind:
- Older guides are helpful but not canonical.
- Use current standards (e.g., service calls now use `action:` blocks as of 2024.8).
- Configuration best practices evolve—prioritize clarity and maintainability.

---

## ✅ 8. Final Tips for Developers

- Think modular first.
- Understand the abstraction layers before adding logic.
- Test components in isolation.
- Add metadata and documentation to every new package or sensor.
- Ask “what will break if this changes?” before refactoring.

---

_This guide is living documentation—keep it updated, and contribute improvements as Hestia evolves._
