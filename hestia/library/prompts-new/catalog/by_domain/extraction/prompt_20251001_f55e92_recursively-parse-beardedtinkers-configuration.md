Recursively parse BeardedTinker’s `configuration.yaml` and all included files from the Home Assistant GitHub repo. Absorb the full structural and semantic configuration: directory layout, inclusion patterns, automation/script structure, naming conventions, UI logic, and integration strategies.

1. Extract core patterns (e.g., `!include_dir_merge_named` usage, folder hierarchy, package strategy).
2. Identify effective practices (idioms) and known anti-patterns.
3. Detect implicit architectural choices (like functional segmentation, state abstraction, or redundancy minimization).
4. Synthesize these insights into a structured, forward-compatible blueprint.
5. Generate a minimalist but expandable seed configuration that mirrors the architecture—ready for cloning or forking.

Goal: I want an idiomatic, future-proof configuration seed that encapsulates the best of BeardedTinker’s architecture without vendor-specific or device-bound elements.
