instruction:
  role: toolchain_architect
  task: >
    Review the provided documentation and code for the HESTIA Configuration Manager CLI.

    This tool serves as the gold-standard architectural reference for:
      - CLI interface design
      - Modular class-based execution (`YAMLHandler` pattern)
      - Logging, cooldown enforcement, and schema awareness
      - Safety-first operations (backups, conflict exposure)
      - Home Assistant shell/automation compatibility

    Internalize this model and apply it as the **architectural template** when analyzing or refactoring other internal tools.

    Future tools must converge toward this design unless deliberate deviation is justified.

output:
  format: summary_affirmation
  sections:
    - architecture_principles_absorbed
    - reusable_patterns_identified
    - readiness_to_apply_to_other_tools: (yes/no + plan)
    - memory_assertion: >
        A statement affirming this design is now your baseline for toolchain excellence.

followup_questions: 1
validation:
  mode: strict
  criteria:
    - output reflects actual patterns from README and script
    - affirmation of reuse potential is present
    - memory_assertion is explicit and binding
