### ðŸ“„ Prompt Body (Reusable Template)

> You are to generate a comprehensive diagnostic report representing a real-time snapshot of the current system state under investigation. This report must include the following structured sections:

#### 1. **Technical Snapshot**

* Identify the tool version and patch level (e.g., `v1.0.3-HOTFIX`, Git SHA if applicable).
* Summarize recent configuration, script, or module changes.
* Confirm:

  * System prerequisites
  * Mount and volume integrity
  * Environment fingerprint: host identity, shell, critical environment variables
  * Dependency availability (e.g., `tar`, `git`, `jq`)

#### 2. **Issue Index (Verifiable)**

* Produce a rational, evidence-backed list of issues grouped by functional area or execution phase.
* Each issue must include references to:

  * Log lines or terminal output
  * Error codes, tracebacks, or system messages
  * Relevant file contents, validation outputs, or missing artifacts
  * **Include UTC timestamps** for all logged events or failure traces

#### 3. **Execution Trail**

* Chronologically reconstruct what has occurred:

  * Phase transitions, retries, and observed outcomes
  * Manual or automated interventions
* Annotate each step with causal insights:

  * Expected vs observed behavior
  * Conditional branches or skipped paths
  * Resource state at key transitions

#### 4. **Expert Synthesis**

* Offer an expert interpretation of all evidence collected.
* Include probable root causes, architectural or logical misalignments, and systemic vs incidental fault distinctions.
* Use internal tool heuristics or failure signatures where applicable.

#### 5. **Remediation Roadmap**

* Propose prioritized next steps, grouped into:

  * **Blocking Remediations** (must-fix to proceed)
  * **Stability Enhancements** (e.g., error handling, logging improvements)
  * **Optimization Opportunities**
* For each action:

  * State estimated impact
  * List dependencies or preconditions
  * Assign a **confidence score (0â€“100)** for its effectiveness.

    > Use â‰¥80 to indicate high deployment readiness.
