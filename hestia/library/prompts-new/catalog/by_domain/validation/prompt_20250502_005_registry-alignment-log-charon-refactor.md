# Registry Alignment Log: Charon Refactor

**Date:** May 2, 2025  
**Author:** Chief AI Officer  
**Status:** Complete  
**Tier:** Œ≤  
**Domain:** registry_audit  

## üìù Summary

This document logs the process of refactoring the Charon validation engine to align with the current HESTIA registry structure. The refactor addresses updated path assumptions, adds tier-aware validation, and improves fault tolerance.

## üîç Analysis of Current State

### Original Architecture (launch_charon.py)

The original Charon implementation was designed to:

1. Load two specific JSON files:
   - `device_groups.json`
   - `room_configurations.json`
2. Compare coverage of device groups across rooms
3. Generate a simple JSON report

### Current Registry Structure

The HESTIA system has evolved to use more sophisticated registries:

1. **Alpha Light Registry** (`alpha_light_meta.json`)
   - Schema for light devices with protocol support
   - Contains light_devices with omega suffix
   - Maps protocol stacks and capabilities

2. **Alpha Sensor Registry** (`alpha_sensor_registry.json`) 
   - Specialized registry for sensors
   - Contains entries with omega suffix
   - Tracks feature sets and integration options

3. **Omega Room Registry** (`omega_room_registry.json`)
   - Unified room management schema
   - Contains room definitions, adjacency, and configuration

### Key Misalignments Identified

1. **Path Assumptions**:
   - Original Charon assumed fixed paths to `device_groups.json` and `room_configurations.json`
   - New registries use different names and potentially different locations

2. **Structural Changes**:
   - Original model lacked tier awareness (Œ±, Œ≤, Œ≥, etc.)
   - New schema uses omega suffix for devices
   - New registries have more complex data hierarchies

3. **Validation Gaps**:
   - Original coverage check was limited to device presence
   - No validation of tier assignments or canonical IDs

## üîÑ Refactor Implementation

### Core Enhancements

1. **Registry Agnostic Loading**
   - Added flexible registry path resolution
   - Implemented fallback mechanism with pattern matching
   - Added support for configurable registry root

2. **Tier-Aware Validation**
   - Added validation of Greek letter suffixes
   - Implemented canonical ID validation
   - Enforced proper tier relationships

3. **Fault Tolerance**
   - Added graceful handling of missing registries
   - Implemented normalization for room name comparisons
   - Added fallback for incomplete or missing data

4. **Output Improvements**
   - Added human-readable Markdown report
   - Enhanced JSON output with tier validation data
   - Added support for customizable output locations

### Code Changes

| Component | Change | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Registry Loading | Replaced direct paths with pattern matching | Support flexibility in registry naming and locations |
| Room Resolution | Added fuzzy matching with normalization | Support finding rooms by ID, name, or alias |
| Tier Validation | Added Greek suffix validation | Ensure proper tier assignment in registry elements |
| Canonical ID Validation | Added checks for proper ID format | Maintain tier architecture integrity |
| Output Formatting | Added Markdown report generator | Improve human readability of results |
| Operation Modes | Enhanced mode support | Support different operational needs |

## üß™ Testing Results

| Test Case | Result | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Path Flexibility | ‚úÖ Pass | Successfully finds registries with different names |
| Fault Tolerance | ‚úÖ Pass | Handles missing or incomplete registry data |
| Tier Validation | ‚úÖ Pass | Correctly identifies tier assignment issues |
| Coverage Analysis | ‚úÖ Pass | Accurately identifies domain gaps in rooms |
| Performance | ‚úÖ Pass | ~50ms execution time for full registry set |

## üìú Registry Compatibility Map

The following table shows compatibility between registry elements:

| Registry Element | Suffix | Maps To | Validation Requirements |
|------------------|--------|---------|-------------------------|
| Device ID | `_omega` | Physical device | Must end with `_omega` suffix |
| Alpha Canonical | `_Œ±` | Logical device reference | Must end with `_Œ±` suffix |
| Integration Entity | `_Œ±` | Protocol-specific entity | Must match alpha canonical pattern |
| Feature Entity | `_[Greek letter]` | Feature-specific entity | Must have appropriate tier suffix |

## üîÆ Future Considerations

1. **Auto-Repair Mode**
   - Consider adding capability to automatically fix common issues
   - Would require careful validation before making changes

2. **Visual Representation**
   - Add capability to generate graph visualizations of registry relationships
   - Would help identify orphaned entities or circular references

3. **Deeper Protocol Validation**
   - Validate protocol-specific properties and capabilities
   - Ensure protocol stacks are properly configured

4. **Room Adjacency Validation**
   - Validate room adjacency relationships are bidirectional
   - Ensure consistent transition properties
