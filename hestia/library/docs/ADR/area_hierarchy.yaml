  notes: |
    This contract is programmatically validated against live Home Assistant registry data. Coverage and consistency are updated on each validation run.
    Conservative fix 2025-10-01: Fixed null floor_id assignments only, preserved all area names and timestamps.

notes: |
  The purpose of this contract is to standardize spatial reasoning in registry rehydration.
  All subarea relationships must be explicitly declared to avoid inference ambiguity.
  This file does not govern device placement, but entity logic implication.
  Changes to inference propagation require a new contract version.
