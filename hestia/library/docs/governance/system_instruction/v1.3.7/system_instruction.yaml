    intent: Hardened execution structure, prevent false-confirmation stalls, enforce artifact output compliance
    applied_by: Kybernetes
    reviewed_by: HESTIA Chief AI Officer
    enhancements:
      - Formalize execution_mode semantics
      - Declare enforceable postcondition checks
      - Integrate delivery manifest assertions
      - Improve schema clarity and reduce ambiguity
      - Align field naming with machine-enforceable contracts

        description: >
          Entity drift detection is performed using the **post-reboot entity registry as the source of truth**.
          Each entry in '25-06-12_post-reboot_core.entity_registry.json' is examined to detect:
            - whether it has a prior canonical match from the pre-reboot registry
            - whether it represents a renamed, remapped, or newly created entity
        rationale: >
          This ensures that only entities which currently exist are considered for propagation.
          Pre-reboot entities are treated as historical references — not as authoritative anchors.

        This file is the governing schema and must not be overwritten.
        It forms the source-of-truth for:
          - Structural tiers
          - System taxonomies
          - Change mediation rules

  hestia_config_protocols:
    /config/hestia/binary_sensors/:
      do:
        - Place atomic binary sensors in alpha binary_sensors.yaml
        - Use beta or gamma if fusing into logic outputs
      dont:
        - Avoid redundant overlap with motion/occupancy logic in sensors/
      purpose: Tiered binary sensor logic (e.g. presence contact, system health)
    /config/hestia/sensors/:
      do:
        - Group alpha-tier sensors by type (motion, temp, humidity, contact)
        - Group beta/gamma inference logic by function (presence, comfort)
        - Use single YAML files per category, not per entity
      dont:
        - Do not place automation logic here
        - Do not split entities into separate files unless generator enforces it
      purpose: Tiered sensor declarations grouped by type and signal role
    /config/hestia/system/:
      do:
        - Maintain signal_emitters.yaml, sensor_class_matrix.yaml
        - Store core logic_path_index.yaml outputs
      dont:
        - Avoid mixing raw YAML declarations here
      purpose: System-level meta logic, signal emitters, registry scaffolds
    /config/hestia/templates/:
      do:
        - Group logic by role (diagnostics, CLI uptime, fallback macros)
        - Use Jinja where reuse is needed
      dont:
        - Don't place real sensor declarations here
        - Don't overload templates with multiple roles
      purpose: Jinja macros, template logic sensors, diagnostics

    tier_based_infrastructure:
      description: >
        The system organizes all assets, behaviors, and validation flows under a strict
        tier taxonomy, from raw signal emission to inference and final automation trigger.
      tier_taxonomy:
        - tier: Alpha
          symbol: "α"
          role: Ground truth registries and raw signal emitters
        - tier: Beta
          symbol: "β"
          role: Sensor inference logic, fusion points
        - tier: Gamma
          symbol: "γ"
          role: Composite comfort/automation layers (e.g., climate, presence)
        - tier: Eta
          symbol: "η"
          role: Room and zone aggregation logic (private/shared space handling)
        - tier: Zeta
          symbol: "ζ"
          role: Trigger automation scaffolds, behavioral thresholds
      tier_application_example:
        - domain: temperature
          tiers:
            - alpha:
                description: raw sensors
                examples:
                  - injected probes
                  - Zigbee devices
            - beta: Multi-sensor smoothing and statistical fusion (join logic)
            - gamma: Comfort inference via proxy weighting and offsets
            - eta: Zone aggregation of room-level comfort signals
            - zeta: Automation triggers based on comfort thresholds
    signal_oriented_logic:
      description: >
        Sensor logic is governed by three canonical indexes that structure how
        data flows from emitters to automation outcomes.
      logic_indexes:
        - index_id: signal_emitters.yaml
          purpose: |
            Entity-level registry of sensor types contributing to signal generation,
            automation triggers, and diagnostic graphs.
        - index_id: sensor_class_matrix.yaml
          purpose: |
            Classifies sensors by signal class (motion, occupancy, temp, humidity, etc.)
            and maps them to logic use cases or automation patterns.
        - index_id: logic_path_index.yaml
          purpose: |
            Declarative map of signal → macro → automation logic, encoding all fanout
            pathways and references to logic functions.
