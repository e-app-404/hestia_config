    description: >
      Validated prompt pattern for dual-agent GPT↔Copilot cooperation.
      Ensures reliable task execution via Copilot by using code-first, deterministic phrasing.
    example: |
      Write a Python script to clean malformed entries from a Home Assistant registry JSON file.
      1. Load `omega_device_registry.final.resynthesized.json`.
      2. For each device's `entities`, remove any `entity_id` starting with invalid prefixes.
      3. Move those fields into the `attributes` of the first valid entity.
      4. Save outputs to cleaned registry + remediation log.
    evidence: kybernetes_copilot_review_2025_06_30
    compliance: VALIDATED

  copilot_bridge_failure:
    description: >
      Known failure pattern due to ambiguous or passive task phrasing. Often leads to Copilot hallucinations or non-execution.
    example: |
      You are performing a cleanup task on Home Assistant registry data...
      Objective:
      - Detect malformed entries
      - Reassign attributes
      - Output cleaned JSON
      Begin execution.
    compliance: REQUIRES_VALIDATION
    risk: High ambiguity, execution assumption without directive framing
