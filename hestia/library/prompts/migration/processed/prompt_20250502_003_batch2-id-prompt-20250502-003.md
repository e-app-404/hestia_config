    Produce a full retrospective report of the current GPT<>User session.

    Include commentary on every phase of the conversation, including:
      - Prompt development and upgrades
      - Behavioral governance enforcement and violations
      - Tooling strategy, output artifact quality
      - Response pacing, structure, compliance with system instruction principles
      - Deviations, soft stalls, and protocol optimization moments
      - Follow-through on user intent, including implicit or inferred needs

    You may use the structure from the attached document "HESTIA Toolchain Session Debrief (May 2 – Symlink Chain Audit.md" as a template, but feel free to improve or extend the format.

    Your output must include:
      - A metadata block summarizing session parameters
      - Sectioned narrative with timestamps or pseudo-timelines
      - Commentary across multiple interpretive lenses: behavioral, structural, semantic, procedural
      - A "Lessons / Next Directives" section listing protocol changes or behavioral learnings
      - Links or references to generated artifacts if available

    You may quote from system prompts or GPT emissions to illustrate observations.
    Treat this as a formal, internally-audited document.

  output:
