**Execute this optimization completely. Provide all files in full with no placeholders. Include comprehensive apply procedures and validation suite. Demonstrate clear benefits over current implementation.**

      phases:
        - name: analysis_design
          persona: strategos_gpt
          instructions: |
            Analyze current vacuum package inefficiencies and design optimized architecture.
            Focus on Variable component benefits, MQTT command improvements, and entity reduction opportunities.
            Provide quantitative analysis of current vs optimized approach.

                # Valetudo Optimization Analysis
                ## Current State Assessment
                - Entity inventory: 12 input helpers
                - Command reliability issues with vacuum.send_command
                - Limited error handling and notification capabilities
                
                ## Optimization Opportunities
                - HACS Variable consolidation potential
                - MQTT command modernization requirements
                - Error handling enhancement areas
                
                ## Benefits Projection
                - Entity reduction: X% decrease
                - Reliability improvement: MQTT vs send_command
                - Performance gains: reduced automation triggers

      This promptset targets ChatGPT-5 Thinking model for comprehensive Valetudo optimization.
      Includes complete context analysis, technical requirements, and production validation.
      Designed for single-execution optimization with complete deliverables.

  extensibility:
    - Adapt segment mapping for different robot models by updating valetudo.conf
    - Extend room definitions by adding new Variable attributes and automation triggers
    - Integrate additional Valetudo capabilities (zones, go-to locations) using same MQTT patterns
    - Scale notification system for multiple robots using topic prefixes

  documentation:
    - Reference: Valetudo MQTT API documentation at valetudo.cloud
