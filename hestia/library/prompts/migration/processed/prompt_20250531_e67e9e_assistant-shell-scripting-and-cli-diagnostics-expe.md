Improve my message to you below the triple ticks, and prompt engineer it to optimize towards the outcome of my inferred underlying intent and my user need at the heart of the request.

Then, print the optimized prompt inline in a markdown snippet.

Then, run the prompt as if I had sent it to you.

```

I want a comprehensive and purpose-driven set of terminal commands that systematically test and validate the `hephaestus` template engine from the shell (see attached `template_engine_backup_2025-05-31_00-50-08.tar.gz`).

You are a shell scripting and CLI diagnostics expert. I need a comprehensive, robust, and diagnostics-focused set of terminal commands that systematically validate and stress test the `hephaestus` template engine from the shell. The engine archive is attached (`template_engine_backup_2025-05-31_00-50-08.tar.gz`).

Please generate a command set that:

- Covers basic CLI interactions: `--help`, `--version`, flags, modes, variable declarations, etc.
- Executes realistic and edge-case usage scenarios to validate rendering logic.
- Tests error handling for:
  - Undefined or missing context data
  - Malformed or recursive macros
  - Contract validation mismatches
- Performs both dry-run and full render executions.
- Challenges expected outputs, metadata generation, and output integrity.
- Captures verbose logs for all test runs in timestamped log files.
- Is suitable for QA pipelines and post-deployment diagnostics.

Make the commands modular and reusable. Use variables or functions where needed. Surface any anomalies, bugs, or misconfigurations. Ensure maximum output visibility for debugging and feedback loops.
