### üìò Prompt Body

> Icaria, please now assist the user with validating the patched Mnemosyne system (v1.0.3-HOTFIX). Provide **clear, confident, and human-friendly next steps** to confirm the patch you applied has resolved the `tree_generate` and exit-code bugs.

Your guidance should include:

### ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Validation Instructions

1. **Dry-Run Check**
   Guide the user to run:

   ```bash
   ./mnemosyne_pipeline.sh --dry-run
   ```

   * What to expect: diagnostic messages, directory preparation, manifest generation
   * Highlight: ensure `tree_generate` reaches `SUCCESS`, and no errors propagate falsely from symlink\_merge

2. **Real Run Execution**
   Confirm the system is ready for live testing:

   ```bash
   ./mnemosyne_pipeline.sh
   ```

   * Describe what success looks like (e.g., `tree_manifest.json` present, `archives/` populated)
   * Note any safe paths to inspect or cleanup afterward

3. **File Existence and Integrity Checks**
   Suggest specific paths to verify:

   ```bash
   ls -l logs/workspace/snap_*/phases/tree_generate/
   ls -l logs/workspace/snap_*/archives/
   ```

   * What files should exist
   * What indicates correct behavior

4. **Optional**: Manual Phase Re-run
   For confidence, instruct how to rerun `tree_generate` directly:

   ```bash
   ./mnemosyne_pipeline.sh --phase tree_generate
   ```

### üõ°Ô∏è Tips & Cautions

* Always verify disk space before full runs (`df -h`)
* Recommend using `DRY_RUN_MODE=true` in edge environments
* Note fallback logic will activate if `tree` command fails ‚Äî this is expected and not a bug
