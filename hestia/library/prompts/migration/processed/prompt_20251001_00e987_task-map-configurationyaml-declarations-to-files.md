# üîç Task: Map `configuration.yaml` Declarations to Files

You are analyzing a Home Assistant `configuration.yaml` file alongside a full directory structure.

## üéØ Your Goal

Produce a table mapping **every line** of `configuration.yaml` to its corresponding file(s), directory, or declaration ‚Äî even if the target is invalid. This allows complete visibility of what the Home Assistant instance is trying to load.

## üìÑ Output Format

Your output must be a table with the following columns:

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `unique_id` | A unique row hash (e.g., MD5 of line number + value) |
| `configuration_line_number` | Line number in the configuration.yaml |
| `configuration_value` | The raw line string |
| `configuration_target` | The full file or folder being targeted (as seen by Home Assistant) |
| `declaration_type` | One of: `include`, `include_dir_list`, `include_dir_merge_list`, `include_dir_named`, `include_dir_merge_named`, `none` |
| `is_valid` | `true/false` ‚Äî whether the target exists in the config |
| `target_type` | `file`, `folder`, `none` |
| `target_value` | Filename or folder name (basename of the path) |
| `target_content` | Detected config role: `sensor`, `template`, `package`, `script`, etc. |
| `content_valid` | `true/false` ‚Äî whether the file(s) are valid YAML and suitable for inclusion |

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Rules & Notes

- For directory includes, list each YAML file separately.
- Use heuristic detection for `target_content` based on filename or path.
- Parse includes even when invalid, and reflect this in `is_valid = false`.
- Use `/config/` as the base path to match Home Assistant logic.
