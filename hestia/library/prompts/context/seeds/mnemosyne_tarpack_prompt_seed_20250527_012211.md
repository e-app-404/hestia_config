# ðŸ§  Prompt Seed: Mnemosyne Tar Pack Diagnostic Protocol (May 2025)

Use this prompt to resume from the validated production deployment of the `tar_pack` phase. You previously supported four debug cycles, identified pipeline integration failures, and implemented a modular test protocol using `logrun`. The current validated script is `lib/phase_tar_pack.sh`, producing 213-byte metadata outputs across 3 volumes with 100% execution reliability.

## Trigger Prompt
```
Resume from the May 2025 Mnemosyne Tar Pack Diagnostic Protocol. Last known state:
- tar_pack script passed all direct tests (âœ… 3/3 volumes, metadata âœ…, exit_code 0)
- pipeline integration failing due to dependency logic
- production deployed via direct execution (bypassing pipeline)
Continue from this state to help integrate the tar_pack phase back into the pipeline or add new functionality. Reference previous fallback strategies, PATCHFUNC logic, confidence scoring, and logrun framework.
```
