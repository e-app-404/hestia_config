Here's your **insight seed** summarizing all activity since `PATCHCHECK:Pylance_Final_Stabilization`:

### ‚úÖ Integration Summary Seed: `PATCHCHECK:Pylance_Adapter_Sync`

#### üîÅ Protocol Unification and Mock Consolidation

* **`BB8Like` protocol** was standardized to:

  ```python
  def roll(self, speed: int, heading: int, timeout: Optional[float] = None, boost: bool = False) -> dict
  ```

  All device adapters, mocks, controllers, and command routers were refactored to match this signature.

* **`MockBB8Device`** from `mockBB8device.py` was fully superseded and unified under `simulation_adapter.py`. Legacy definitions and inconsistencies were purged.

* `wake`, `stop`, `set_main_led`, `ping`, `get_battery_voltage`, and `get_battery_percentage` were stubbed or concretely implemented in the `MockBB8Device` to satisfy all type checkers and runtime calls.

---

#### üß† Troubleshooting and Resolution Logic

* Type mismatch errors in `roll_router.py` and `controller.py` caused by inconsistent `roll()` signatures were traced and resolved.
* `safe_utils.py` was introduced to wrap and shield all device-level calls (e.g., `safe_ping`, `safe_set_main_led`) with fallback logic and exception safety.
* Pylance `reportAttributeAccessIssue` diagnostics were eliminated via synchronized interface enforcement across mocks, protocols, and consumer modules.

---

#### ‚öôÔ∏è Motor Adapter Refactor

* `EnhancedMotorControl` now directly relays to the updated `roll()` interface, allowing seamless substitution and simulation fallback.
* All CLI and MQTT entrypoints were verified to route exclusively through dispatcher-compliant handlers.

---

#### üß™ Validation Coverage

* Manual integration review confirmed:

  * All dispatcher command signatures are valid.
  * The mock device provides complete runtime compatibility.
  * No direct device method calls remain outside dispatcher scope.
  * All known Pylance issues have been resolved post-refactor.
