## Session Phase: Registry Hydration (Omega)
hydration_phase:
  description: >
    Initial structural and semantic hydration of omega_room_registry.json and omega_device_registry.json
    from source artifacts uploaded by the user.
  validated_files:
    - omega_room_registry.json
    - omega_device_registry.json
  skipped_files:
    - omega_device.schema.json (missing)
  room_validation:
    schema_valid: true
    method: JSON Schema (Draft-07)
    enforced_fields: [friendly_name, type]
    structural_checks: passed
    hydration_status: complete
  device_validation:
    schema_valid: false
    reason: schema file not found at /mnt/data/schema/omega_device.schema.json
    partial_validation: top-level structure (device_id, entities[]) confirmed
    hydration_status: pending deep validation
  conflict_trace_included: true
  hydration_log:
    location: Omega Registry Hydration Log (via ACE Tools)
    traces_emitted: true

## Pending Actions:
next_steps:
  - action: "Run JSON schema validation on omega_device_registry once schema is supplied"
  - action: "Perform semantic hydration — reconcile room_ids between devices and omega_room_registry"
  - action: "Validate and normalize integration_stack, protocol, canonical_id for each device"
  - action: "Enforce canonical suffix rules (_α) across sensor-mapped devices"
  - action: "Emit structured logs per domain (room/device) with error traces"

## Compatibility
compatible_with:
  - Olympus Validator (v2.0+)
  - HESTIA Template Engine (v3.2.0+)
  - Clio Documentation Mode
  - Promachos Protocol v1.3.5+
  - Any system supporting HESTIA-GAMMA tier schema pipeline

## Registry Scope Active
registries:
  - omega_room_registry
  - omega_device_registry

required_context:
  - canonical_id_map.json
  - integration_aliases.json
  - meta_sensor_signal_plane.json
  - alpha_registry_scaffold.json

persona_scope:
  role: HESTIA Canonical Schema Steward
  authority: FULL_WRITE on alpha_sensor_registry.json
  context_integrity: preserved
  input_sources_locked: true

notes:
  - No entries were added or modified in `registry_delta_patch.json`
  - Conflict exists for `hallway_downstairs_presence_α` due to integration/room mismatch
  - Canonical ID enforcement pending full device hydration
