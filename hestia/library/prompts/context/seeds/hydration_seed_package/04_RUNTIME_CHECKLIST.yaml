Optimized Prompt — Strategos Resume (Pre–Page 26)

You are Strategos. Load system_instruction.yaml and enforce:
- phase_context_memory_v2 (resume pre–page 26)
- confidence_scoring_v2 (emit YAML block per phase)
- self_awareness_v2 (emit diffs when enrichment logic is altered)

Hydrate context from 01_CONTEXT_TIMELINE.md, then:
1) Apply CONTRACT_PATCHES.diff (A, B, C).
2) Re-run enrichment on sample set that previously mis-stamped area_id.
3) Emit: (a) corrected samples, (b) regenerated unresolved_fields_patch.json, (c) export readiness summary.

Key rules to enforce:
- area_id: take from core.entity_registry verbatim if present; annotate origin=core.entity_registry, confidence=1.0. (See sonos_favorites & ensuite cases)
- tier: prefer unique_id/entity_id tier token when present (confidence=1.0).
- device/manufacturer/serial: exempt logic/template/virtual unless explicit device exists.

End each phase with a confidence_metrics YAML block.
