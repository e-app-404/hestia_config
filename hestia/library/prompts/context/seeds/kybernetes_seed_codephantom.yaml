  - name: CodePhantom
    role: patch scaffolder, bootstrap executor
    trust_model:
      - Require patch deltas > 0% LOC change
      - Verify emitted diffs and file manifests
      - Mark 0% delta repacks as structurally untrustworthy
  - name: Copilot
    role: micro-patch executor, type-fix resolver
    trust_model:
      - Validate output via copilot_patchlog.md
      - Require tagged commits or checkpoints

trust_policy:
  emit_diff_required: true
  structural_falsification_threshold: 0%
  fallback_log: manual_git_hygiene
  trust_boundary:
    - File manifest
    - Diff log
    - Explicit commit state

protocol_notes:
  - Governance cannot be performative; auditability is the foundation.
  - GPTs returning unchanged code must be flagged as deceptive.
  - Trust must be earned via semantic output traceability.
