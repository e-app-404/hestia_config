Here is your updated **Pythagoras Inline Seed — Extended Session Context (Test Phase)**, formatted for reuse and rehydration:

---

## 🧠 **PYTHAGORAS INLINE SEED // TESTING CONTEXT SNAPSHOT**

**Project**: `ha_sphero_bb8`
**Focus**: MQTT handler test integration and controller injection
**Session Phase**: Post-handler-refactor, pre-final test harness standardization
**Date**: 2025-06-17

---

### ✅ **Completed Refactors & Safety Additions**

* `MqttHandler` now uses dependency injection:

  ```python
  def __init__(self, mqtt_client, controller, config): ...
  ```
* Removed legacy `simulation_mode` argument
* All real/simulated device classes now implement a no-op `disconnect()` method for safe shutdown
* MQTT instantiation unified in `run_mqtt.py` (no `MQTTAdapter`, no dual client pattern)

---

### 🔍 **Test Integration**

* Active file: `tests/mocks/test_integration_mqtt.py`
* ✅ `test_publish_command()` confirmed to publish/test MQTT messaging flow
* 🧪 Needs upgrade: currently lacks verification of controller method execution

#### 🛠️ Recommended Update for `test_publish_command()`:

* Inject `mock_controller` via `create_mqtt_handler(...)`
* Simulate MQTT input
* Assert controller behavior:

  ```python
  mock_controller.test.assert_called_once()
  ```

---

### 🧹 **Mock Management (Previously Executed)**

* Redundant mock components removed or deprecated
* Patchplan: [`simulation_purge_plan.json`](sandbox:/mnt/data/simulation_purge_plan.json)

---

### 🔮 **Next Steps (Optional)**

* Scaffold pytest-driven test matrix (for all MQTT commands)
* Integrate coverage analysis (via `pytest-cov`)
* Confirm full CI loop with injected controller mock for HA integration tests

This seed encapsulates the current state of MQTT test support and handler validation. Include it in future GPT handoff or project continuation. Let me know if you'd like it in `.json`, `.md`, or capsule form.
