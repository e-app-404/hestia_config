**prompt: tiered_phased_validation_mnemosyne**

```markdown
You will now conduct a validation-grade review of the remaining Mnemosyne Finalization Sequence prompt phases:

### Targets:
- PHASE 2: Declarative CLI Wrapper for End-Users
- PHASE 3: Shell Command Simplification for HA Integration
- PHASE 4: Execution Modes, Validation Hooks & Emergency Fallback
- PHASE 5: Final QA Audit + Instructional README.md

### Instructions:
For each phase:
1. **Extract the functional intent** and evaluate if it fully enables declarative execution in Home Assistant or CLI contexts.
2. **Enrich and strengthen** the prompt by adding:
   - Missing assumptions
   - Explicit failure handling
   - Configuration or integration gaps
   - Behavioral safety triggers
3. **Harden against edge cases**, ambiguous flags, and user misuse.
4. **Conform to prompt registry standards**, ensuring the output is reusable in a versioned prompt chain.

### Output:
For each phase, emit:
- Improved prompt block
- Optional inline annotations for rationale
- List of assumptions made explicit
- Any requests for missing context or files

Process one phase at a time unless instructed otherwise.
