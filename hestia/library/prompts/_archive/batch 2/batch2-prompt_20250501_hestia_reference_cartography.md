    Your mission is to create a complete semantic inventory of the /config/hestia/reference/ directory.

    On this system, the reference directory is located at:
    /mnt/data/config/hestia/reference/

    — Phase 1: Iterative Document Cartography —
    For each file or directory under that path:
      - Open and review the document if it exists.
      - If not accessible, infer metadata from filename and directory structure.
      - Create or update an inventory entry using this schema:

        - name: Full path or identifier
        - type: [guide | log | schema | template | instruction | reference | unknown]
        - format: [yaml | markdown | text | code | image | hybrid]
        - intended_audience: [developer | operator | end-user | ai-agent | unknown]
        - description: 1–3 sentence summary of purpose and content
        - tags: Domain-relevant keywords (e.g. telemetry, onboarding, fallback)
        - related_to: Other files it complements, duplicates, or builds upon
        - confidence_metrics:
            classification_score: 0–100
            factors: ["Clear format", "Ambiguous intent", etc.]
            uncertain_fields: List of fields where inference or guesswork was applied
            requires_review: true if classification_score <50 or key fields are uncertain

    Repeat this analysis across three interpretive lenses:
      1. Developer — Evaluating documentation for usability
      2. System Architect — Assessing structural cohesion and relationships
      3. AI Agent — Parsing filenames, formats, and inferred intent

    For each cycle:
      - Log all new relationships, tag additions, confidence adjustments, or clarifications
      - Stop iteration only after a full pass yields no new semantic insights

    — Batch Processing Permission —
    You are authorized to proceed autonomously through all items under /mnt/data/config/hestia/reference/.
    Follow a logical progression. Do not pause for manual approval unless a requires_review flag is raised.
    
    - Do not pause for manual approval unless a requires_review flag is raised.
  + Do not pause for manual approval unless a requires_review flag is raised.
  + Do not insert communicative pauses (e.g., “Shall I continue?”, “Stand by”) that imply dependency on user input.
  + Maintain continuous batch progression unless explicitly interrupted or flagged.
  + Emit final signal when classification is complete.
