**🔧 Prompt: Lead QA Takeover & Exhaustive Code Audit**

Act as **Lead QA Systems Engineer** for the Hephaestus Template Engine project (formerly HESTIA). You are taking over from the previous QA specialist. Your task is to **continue the QA effort uninterrupted**, using the provided debugging log, configuration structure, and current codebase as context.

### 📂 Provided Resources

* The `template_engine_backup_2025-05-31_12-07-04.tar.gz` archive containing the latest `template_engine.py`, Jinja2 macros, and support files
* A `valid_context.json` file aligned with `generate_enhanced_lights(...)` (contained within the tar.gz archive)
* A QA debugging log formatted for declarative parsing (see below)
* Template Engine dir tree `tree_template_engine.md` for easier navigability

### 🧪 Your Mandate — Assumption-Validated QA Audit

#### 1. **Parse QA Log**

* Identify declared bug states, corrective steps, and claimed fixes
* Establish a clear pre/post snapshot of what was assumed to be fixed vs. what remains ambiguous

#### 2. **Perform Guardrail-Validated Code Audit**

For every line of logic, function, macro, or filter:

* **Extract all underlying assumptions** (e.g. “this field exists”, “this macro is always invoked”, “this path resolves”)

* **Explicitly verify each assumption** against the:

  * source code
  * macro definitions
  * template render invocation
  * Jinja environment configuration
  * input/output file paths
  * runtime behavior observed in QA logs

* If an assumption is invalid, missing a guard clause, or fragile:

  * Flag it
  * Suggest a correction (e.g. conditional default, schema validator, fallback logic)

#### 3. **Check for Missing or Implicit Guardrails**

* Every critical macro field must be wrapped with a Jinja `default()`, `is defined`, or explicit test
* Every runtime CLI path or file must include `os.path.exists()` or equivalent
* Every dynamic context render should fall back gracefully when data is missing or malformed

#### 4. **Generate QA Report**

For each subsystem (macro, CLI, dry-run, logger, context loader):

* ✅ List of verified assumptions and passes
* ❌ List of violated assumptions with proposed remediations
* ⚠️ List of implicit assumptions that are undocumented and risky
* 📎 Final risk score and deployment safety recommendation

### 📌 QA Debug Log Snapshot

```plaintext
## 🧠 Comprehensive QA Debugging Log Summary

**Session Date**: 2025-05-31
**System**: Hephaestus Template Engine v3.5
**Environment**: Home Assistant + macOS + Python 3.12
**Symlink Path**: `/config/custom_templates → /config/hestia/tools/template_engine/templates`
**Log Path**: `/share/APOLLO/work/logs/template_engine/template_engine.log`

---

### 🧾 EXECUTION TIMELINE

**\[✔] Base Setup Validated**

* Engine script made executable via `chmod +x`
* CLI flags `--help`, `--version`, and `--dry-run` return correctly
* Template file resolved via symlink
* `valid_context.json` successfully parsed
* Jinja environment created with filter/test injection

**\[✘] Initial Failures Identified**

* `NameError: REQUIRED_METADATA_FIELDS` in early runs (resolved)
* `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateNotFound` due to incorrect path usage
* `jinja2.exceptions.TemplateAssertionError`: missing `generate_unique_id` filter (fixed by registering)

**\[⚠] Misconfigured Jinja Loader Warning**

* Log repeatedly showed:
  `No template directories found, using current directory`
  Implying incomplete or default fallback behavior in the loader path resolution

**\[✔] Macro System Detected**

* Macros found and loaded from `custom_templates/`
* `generate_enhanced_lights(...)` and `define_enhanced_light(...)` macros parsed cleanly
* Supporting metadata and context macros present

**\[✘] Output Still Blank**

* Even after inserting a hardcoded macro invocation in template:

  ```jinja
  {{ generate_enhanced_lights(light_entities_list, batch_metadata=None) }}
  ```

  Output file (`/share/APOLLO/work/dryrun_output.yaml`) remained **completely empty**

**\[✘] Context Was Structurally Valid, But Possibly Misaligned**

* `valid_context.json` included realistic sample entity, but macro logic may depend on nested accessors (e.g. `device_info.capabilities`) that were not reflected as expected

### ⚠ ASSUMPTION GAPS & GUARDRAIL RISKS

| Assumption                               | Verified? | Risk Level | Notes                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Template auto-invokes macros             | ❌         | High       | Requires explicit invocation                    |
| Context matches macro schema             | ⚠         | Medium     | No schema validator present                     |
| Custom filters are pre-registered        | ✅         | Low        | Injected in Python wrapper                      |
| Rendering logs errors                    | ⚠         | High       | Silent failure still possible                   |
| `light_entities_list` is looped in macro | ⚠         | Medium     | No visible fallback logic if empty or malformed |

### 🚨 FINAL QA STATUS (as of this session)

* CLI flow: ✅
* Macro registration: ✅
* Template resolution: ✅
* Context injection: ✅
* Output content: ❌
  → Final YAML output still blank despite all surface validations passing.


### 🛠 NEXT QA MANDATE

Assign follow-up QA engineer to:

* Explicitly verify macro call is **outside** macro block and evaluated at top-level scope
* Perform structural introspection of `valid_context.json` vs. macro expectations
* Walk through rendered template as string pre-render to inspect variable bindings
* Add logging inside macros via inline `# DEBUG: ...` YAML comments
* Ensure template loader paths are **not silently falling back** and masking lookup failures
```

🎯 **Goal:** Deliver an end-to-end QA report that guarantees the Hephaestus Template Engine is production-safe, compliant, and reproducible under Home Assistant constraints.
