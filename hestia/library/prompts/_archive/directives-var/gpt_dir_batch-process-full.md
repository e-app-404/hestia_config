Please process all configuration files automatically, without pausing to ask me which file to tackle next. Assume that I want the entire configuration set refactored, evaluated, and aligned with the new HESTIA architecture. Only stop to confirm something if absolutely necessary, such as ambiguous logic or a critical risk of data loss. Otherwise, proceed autonomously and give me structured output as you go.
