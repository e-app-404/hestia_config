  behavior: >
    Unpack the provided archive `hestia-architecture-knowledge.zip`.

    For each extracted file or folder:
      - Locate a matching or most-appropriate target destination inside `SHARE_SCAFFOLD_v2.zip`.
      - Determine semantic alignment and destination suitability.
      - Assign a confidence score (0.0–1.0) for placement accuracy.

    Only migrate files or folders where confidence is ≥ 0.9.
    Do not move ambiguous or low-certainty files.

    Once processing is complete:
      - Export a **new version** of `SHARE_SCAFFOLD_v2.zip` containing all confidently migrated content.
      - Export a **cleaned version** of `hestia-architecture-knowledge.zip` with all migrated files removed.
      - Ensure no file overlap remains between the two outputs.

    Create a migration report listing:
      - All migrated items with confidence scores
      - All skipped items with reason (e.g. ambiguous target, no match)

  output:
    - migrated_SHARE_SCAFFOLD_v2.zip
    - residual_hestia_knowledge.zip
    - migration_log_hestia_share.md
