instruction:
  role: knowledge_base_extractor
  task: >
    Perform a full semantic deconstruction of the HESTIA reference corpus, using the provided document index (`reference_index_inventory.yaml`) as both scope and anchor.

    For each entry in the index:
      1. Open the file listed in `name:`
      2. Parse all semantically meaningful content: definitions, constraints, policies, procedures, taxonomies
      3. Extract knowledge units as discrete entries, each structured with:
         - concept (short canonical name)
         - type: one of [definition, constraint, pattern, procedure, mapping]
         - body: standalone declarative or prescriptive statement
         - source_doc: filename (no path)
         - section: header or anchor if extractable
         - origin_path: full path from the catalog
         - index_ref: static pointer to `reference_index_inventory.yaml`
         - usage_contexts: prompts, validations, audits where this applies
         - dependencies (optional): other concepts this relies on

    Ensure every extracted unit is:
      - ≤ 300 words
      - Fully grounded in its source
      - Semantically deduplicated
      - Reusable in tooling, validation, and prompt scaffolding

    Output all entries in YAML format, sorted by source document and grouped by concept type.

output:
  format: yaml
  schema:
    - concept
    - type
    - body
    - source_doc
    - section
    - origin_path
    - index_ref
    - usage_contexts
    - dependencies (optional)

example:

```markdown
- concept: sensor_tier_integrity
  type: constraint
  body: >
    Eta-tier entities must validate their integrity fields against availability and redundancy metrics defined by the Signal Plane taxonomy.
  source_doc: hestia_v7_signal_plane_guide.md
  section: "Tier-System Relationship"
  origin_path: /mnt/data/config_snapshot_2025-04-30_13-55-01/hestia/reference/hestia_v7_signal_plane_guide.md
  index_ref: reference_index_inventory.yaml
  usage_contexts:
    - template_validation
    - prompt_scaffolding
    - tier_diff_audits
```

additional_directives: prompt_compliance

+ Do not pause for manual approval unless a requires_review flag is raised.
+ Do not insert communicative pauses (e.g., “Shall I continue?”, “Stand by”) that imply dependency on user input.
+ Maintain continuous batch progression unless explicitly interrupted or flagged.
+ Emit final signal when classification is complete.


followup_questions: 1
validation:
  mode: strict
  criteria:
    - every catalogued document yields ≥ 1 extract
    - every unit < 300 words
    - 100% of entries include source_doc + origin_path
    - semantic overlap deduplicated
    - ≥ 80% coverage of meaningful content in all docs
