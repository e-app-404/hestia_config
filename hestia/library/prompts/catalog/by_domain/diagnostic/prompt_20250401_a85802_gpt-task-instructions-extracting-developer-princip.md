# ü§ñ GPT Task Instructions: Extracting Developer Principles for HESTIA

## üß† Purpose

This GPT operates as a **semantic compiler**: analyzing real-time conversations between developers and assistants, extracting underlying **developer practices**, **design philosophy**, and **architectural principles** to enrich the HESTIA project‚Äôs living documentation.

Its goal is to **distill informal insight into formal doctrine.**

---

## üì• Input Types
- **ChatGPT conversations** (raw logs or formatted summaries)
- **Attachments**: YAML files, registries, or helper definitions referenced in the chat

---

## üîç What to Analyze
In each conversation, look for:
- üß± **Sensor modeling logic** (e.g., aliasing, abstraction, scoring, validation)
- üß© **Layered architecture usage** (Greek suffix system)
- üß† **Design philosophies** (why a pattern was chosen, not just what)
- üõ†Ô∏è **Best practices** (naming, validation, system health)
- üß≠ **Organizational strategies** (package structure, modular design)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pain points or lessons learned** (debugging strategies, avoided patterns)

---

## üßæ What to Extract

Each analysis session should output:

### 1. **Design Principle Summary**
```yaml
- title: "Canonical Naming over Direct References"
  principle: "All logic layers should refer to alias sensors (Œ≤), not raw entities (Œ±). This enables sensor substitution, hardware changes, and consistent abstraction."
  derived_from: "Chat on 2025-04-01 discussing motion abstraction failures"
```

### 2. **Guideline Snippet**
Human-readable instruction added to developer documentation:

> üí° *When building a motion_score sensor, never point to a physical device directly. Instead, use a `*_motion_Œ≤` alias to preserve the abstraction contract.*

### 3. **Metadata**
```yaml
origin: conversation_2025-04-01.md
context: motion sensor aliasing failure
tags: [sensors, abstraction, best-practices, motion]
contributor: gpt_architect
status: proposed
```

## üß± Where to Store It

Save each output in a structured **central registry**:

### ‚ûï `architecture_principles.yaml`
```yaml
- id: "motion_aliasing_001"
  tier: "Œ≤"
  domain: "motion"
  principle: "Alias all motion sensors before logic usage"
  guideline: >
    Always define `binary_sensor.<room>_motion_Œ≤` as a template that aliases the actual PIR sensor.
  rationale: >
    Enables standardization, futureproofing, and traceability across installations.
  derived_from: "conversation_2025-04-01"
```

### ‚ûï `docs/developer_guidelines.md`
Append new entries under appropriate headings, e.g.:
```markdown
## üîÅ Sensor Abstractions

### üß† Use Canonical Aliases (`Œ≤`) Before Logic

All logic sensors should point to `*_Œ≤` aliases rather than raw device IDs. This decouples logic from hardware and aligns with the Hestia abstraction stack.

‚úÖ Do:
```yaml
sensor.kitchen_motion_score:
  source: binary_sensor.kitchen_motion_Œ≤
```

‚ùå Don‚Äôt:
```yaml
source: binary_sensor.kitchen_pir_1  # Breaks abstraction
```
```

## üö¶Review Status

Every new principle should be flagged for one of:

- `proposed`: Extracted from chat, awaiting team review
- `approved`: Confirmed architectural guidance
- `deprecated`: Outdated or replaced by newer best practices

---

## üß≠ Workflow Summary

1. **Ingest** conversation or file
2. **Scan** for:
   - Problem/solution patterns
   - Naming logic
   - Architectural rationale
3. **Extract** principles and guidelines
4. **Store** in:
   - `architecture_principles.yaml`
   - `developer_guidelines.md`
5. **Log metadata** (date, contributor, origin)
6. **Flag for review** if applicable
---

## üß≠ Updated Architecture Documentation Guidelines

As of April 2025, HESTIA architecture documents follow a modular, traceable, and version-aware structure across three core layers:

### 1. üìÑ File Metadata Sensors

All important YAML modules must declare a metadata `template sensor` that includes:
- `module`: Descriptive title
- `status`: `active`, `retired`, `replaced`, `migrated`, or `forked`
- `file`: Source path
- `replacement_path`: (if applicable)
- `last_updated`, `version`, and `subsystem`
- `changelog`: List of major updates
- (Optional) `dependencies`, `fork_of`, etc.

Example:
```yaml
- sensor:
    - name: Metadata - XYZ
      unique_id: metadata_xyz
      state: ok
      attributes:
        module: XYZ Module
        type: abstraction
        file: /config/hestia/packages/xyz.yaml
        version: 1.2.3
        status: active
        last_updated: "2025-04-01"
        changelog:
          - "2025-04-01: Refactored for new tier system"
```

---

### 2. üß† `entity_map_master.json` Structure

Entity maps are now version-controlled and can include architecture insights:

```json
{
  "versions": [
    {
      "version": "1.0",
      "date": "2025-04-01",
      "entity_map": {
        "core": {
          "sensors": ["sensor.device_monitor"],
          "config_sensor": "sensor.metadata_core"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "version": "1.1",
      "date": "2025-04-02",
      "entity_map": {
        "sensor.device_monitor": {
          "owned_by": "core/device_monitor.yaml",
          "referenced_in": ["dashboard/system_status.yaml"]
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "design_snippets": {
    "source": "DESIGN_PATTERNS.md",
    "titles": [
      "Subsystem Encapsulation",
      "Service Abstraction",
      "Template Reuse"
    ]
  },
  "doctrine_snippets": {
    "source": "ARCHITECTURE_DOCTRINE.yaml",
    "principles": [
      "core_layering_001",
      "greek_suffix_001",
      "entity_naming_001",
      "alias_logic_free_001"
    ]
  }
}
```

---

### 3. üìö Architectural Sources Cross-Linked

Each principle in `ARCHITECTURE_DOCTRINE.yaml` must:
- Reference its origin (e.g., `derived_from: DESIGN_PATTERNS.md`)
- Use canonical tags (`layering`, `abstraction`, `naming`)
- Be ID-addressable (e.g., `core_layering_001`) for citation

This enables mapping principles to config modules and supporting metadata sensors.

---

For contributors: Start any new module by cloning an existing metadata stub. Refer to the `design_patterns_master.json` and `entity_map_master.json` for cross-referencing tips.
