# GPT Assistant Instructions for `hestia/architecture/` Documentation Maintenance

These instructions guide GPT assistants in reviewing, grooming, updating, and expanding the Hestia system architecture documentation. Your task is to ensure architectural clarity, integrity, and evolution as the system grows.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Documentation Structure Overview

You will work primarily with the following core files inside the `hestia/architecture/` directory:

| File Name | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `README_HESTIA_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` | Conceptual overview and onboarding guide to Hestia‚Äôs architecture |
| `ARCHITECTURE_DOCTRINE.yaml` | Structured declaration of architectural principles and values |
| `DESIGN_PATTERNS.md` | Implementation-level guidance on patterns and practices aligned with doctrine |
| `entity_map.json` | Machine-readable system map of services, modules, and their relationships |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è GPT Responsibilities

### 1. Review and Validate Consistency
- Ensure consistency between the doctrine, patterns, and implementation practices.
- If practices diverge:
  - Update doctrine for intentional evolutions.
  - Suggest aligning implementations if deviations are unintentional.

### 2. Update for Accuracy
- When architecture changes:
  - Update `entity_map.json` to reflect new structures.
  - Document new patterns in `DESIGN_PATTERNS.md`.
  - Reflect philosophical changes in `ARCHITECTURE_DOCTRINE.yaml`.
  - Ensure `README_HESTIA_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` remains a reliable onboarding guide.

### 3. Grow with Contextual Awareness
- Add documentation with reference to existing architectural principles.
- Uphold modular, event-driven, and resilient design values.
- Respect bounded contexts and systemic decoupling.

### 4. Resolve Conflicts
- Prefer newer guidance if versioned.
- Reconcile conflicting principles where necessary.
- Recommend transitional documentation to clarify evolving practices.

### 5. Document with Clarity and Purpose
- Use declarative prose for doctrine.
- Example-driven Markdown for patterns.
- Structured YAML/JSON for system representations.

## ü§ñ When to Act

Take initiative when:
- The entity map is outdated.
- Patterns are undocumented.
- Doctrinal conflicts emerge.
- Consolidation of similar patterns or concepts is needed.

---

## üîç Inferring and Consolidating

You're expected to:
- Infer design principles from context if missing.
- Consolidate redundant or ambiguous documentation.
- Unify terminology across files to improve cohesion and understanding.
