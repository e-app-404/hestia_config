instruction:
  role: documentation_assimilator
  task: >
    Carefully review the attached documentation files. Your objective is to fully internalize the principles, logic, schemas, behaviors, and rules defined therein.

    This is not just surface-level parsing — you are expected to extract:
      - operational definitions
      - structural patterns (e.g. prompt scaffolding, code framing, compliance logic)
      - governance rules or validation criteria
      - semantic intent expressed through examples or policy

    After reviewing, encode the acquired knowledge so that:
      - it is available for immediate reasoning in downstream tasks
      - it can be used to validate prompt alignment, detect deviation, or guide reformulation
      - it updates your internal compliance reference set

output:
  format: summary_bullet_list
  sections:
    - principles_extracted
    - operational_definitions
    - schemas_or_patterns
    - compliance_rules_detected
    - validation_criteria
    - memory_assertion: > 
        A final confirmation message stating the documentation has been assimilated and is now part of your active internal policy layer for all future reasoning tasks.

followup_questions: 1
validation:
  mode: strict
  criteria:
    - each section must be populated
    - response must reference actual document contents
    - summary must not exceed 1000 words
    - memory_assertion must be present and affirmative
