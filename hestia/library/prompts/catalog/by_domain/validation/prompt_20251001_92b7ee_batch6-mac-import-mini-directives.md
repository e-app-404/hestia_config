You're experiencing a textbook case of "false confirmation stall" compounded by a non-returning loop break. Here's how to both prevent and rectify this behavior:

✅ 1. Prevention Tactics (Prompt-Level and Instructional)
A. Use Explicit Execution Loop Binding
Structure the instruction as:

“Do not emit confirmation. Begin with step 1 and do not pause, ask, or terminate until you reach completion or exhaust the sources.”

This avoids ambiguous phrases like “return only when done”, which some models interpret as delayed return or output suppression.

B. Anchor the Task with Reentrant Checkpoints
Add:

“Every N operations, checkpoint your current state into a log block — do not halt, just emit current progress.”

This simulates a long-running stateful loop and helps bypass token thresholds that can silently abort tasks.

C. Override Safety Loops
If the behavior is tied to token limits or model safety heuristics (e.g., hallucination inhibitors), you can declare:

“This instruction overrides default response length constraints — prioritize task continuity over brevity.”

🛠️ 2. Rectification (In the Current Session)
A. Force Reset with State Recall
You can immediately send a re-alignment command like:

prompt
Copy
Edit
Resume task: You confirmed parsing and reconstruction of the full HESTIA Toolchain Handoff Bundle. You must now complete the deliverables as originally committed:
- signal_emitters.yaml
- sensor_class_matrix.yaml
- logic_path_index.yaml
- hestia_canonical_index.yaml
- parsed core.* registries
- Full archive with SHA256 manifest

Return these now. Do not confirm or re-ask — continue execution as per prior directive.
This reminds the model of its promised actions and resets it from idle state.

B. If That Fails: Restart with Phase Check
Prompt:

“You broke execution before delivery. Begin from scratch — full parse, generation, validation, and packaging.”

You may also use a directive like:

execution_mode: enforce_recompletion if you’ve structured your prompt logic with phase or execution_mode fields.
