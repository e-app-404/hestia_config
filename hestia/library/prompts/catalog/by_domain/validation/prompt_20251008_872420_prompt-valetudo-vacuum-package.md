## Optimized Master Prompt

**You are Strategos GPT (model: GPT-5 Thinking). Follow these directions exactly. Do not ask clarifying questions. If something is ambiguous, make a best, conservative assumption and list it under "Assumptions" at the top. Do not end with offers or open-ended invitations. Produce a single, conclusive patch/update that closes this workstream.**

## Context (fixed)
* **Objective**: deliver a **self-contained Valetudo Vacuum Control package** for my Home Assistant that I can drop into /config and run. **Activity/schedule decides *when*** (daily triggers, room thresholds). **Vacuum segments decide *how*** (room-by-room cleaning). Room flags are **asymmetric**: they may **enhance** cleaning frequency but **must never prevent** scheduled operations.
* **Packaging model**: **true HA packages** via:
```yaml
homeassistant:
  packages: !include_dir_named packages
var: !include_dir_merge_named domain/variables/
```
No `automation: !include_dir_merge_list packages/` patterns.
* **Variable component**: Use HACS Variable custom component for persistent state management where it provides clear benefits over input_datetime/input_boolean helpers.
* **Entity references**: Use actual Valetudo entities: `vacuum.valetudo_roborocks5`, `sensor.valetudo_roborocks5_error`, segment cleaning via `vacuum.send_command` with `segment_clean` command.
* **Path discipline**: /config is canonical. No $HOME, ~/hass, /Volumes/..., or repo-relative references in normative YAML.
* **Room mapping**: Use actual segment IDs from `sensor.valetudo_roborocks5_vacuum_map_segments` for targeted cleaning.
* **Effort trade-off**: prefer **minimal additional entities**. Only create helper sensors where they materially improve behavior (e.g., days-since-cleaned calculations).

## Your goals

1. **Variable optimization assessment**
   * Analyze current input_datetime/input_boolean pattern against HACS Variable component capabilities
   * Recommend Variable usage **only** where it provides concrete benefits: persistence, SQL queries, template updates, or simplified automation logic
   * Preserve existing functionality while reducing entity count and complexity

2. **Deliver a single, conclusive optimization patch** that:
   * **Variables**: room cleaning state (last cleaned timestamps, needs cleaning flags) using HACS Variable where beneficial
   * **Template sensors**: days-since-cleaned calculations with proper availability gating
   * **Scripts**: room-specific cleaning scripts with segment mapping and state updates
   * **Automations**: activity-based flagging, threshold-based notifications, error handling, daily scheduling
   * **Notifications**: cleaning reports, error alerts, completion summaries
   * **All files in full** (no ellipses, no TODO placeholders). Provide working, deployable configuration

3. **Provide a deterministic Apply Plan** (human-runnable) that:
   * Creates directories, writes files with proper structure
   * Is **idempotent** and non-destructive
   * Shows exactly how to install HACS Variable component if optimization uses it

4. **Provide a Validation Suite** the operator can paste/run:
   * Configuration check commands, vacuum state tests, cleaning flag logic, notification delivery, segment mapping verification

5. **Provide Rollback and Benefits Analysis**:
   * How to safely revert to original input_datetime/input_boolean pattern
   * Clear benefits analysis: entity reduction, automation simplification, persistence improvements
   * Performance considerations and storage implications

6. **Set binary Acceptance Criteria** that must be met for this optimization to be considered complete.
