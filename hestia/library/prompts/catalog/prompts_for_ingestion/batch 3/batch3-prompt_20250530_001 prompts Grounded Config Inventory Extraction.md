### üß≠ Counter-Version 1: Grounded Config Inventory Extraction

**(like `prompt_20250530_002`, but for user input)**

```markdown
Please scan the full text I provided and extract a structured inventory of all system components and configuration elements that describe my environment.

Organize the results under the following headers (if applicable):
- Home Assistant Configuration
- MacBook System Info
- Network Environment (LAN, Wi-Fi, Tailscale, etc.)
- VPN Configuration (e.g., Mullvad, Tailscale)
- Hardware Attributes (CPU, Memory, Interfaces, Uptime)
- Diagnostic Tools or CLI Commands
- Sensors, Scripts, and Add-ons (HA or external)

For each item, include:
- Its name or role (e.g., ‚ÄúSamba service‚Äù, ‚ÄúGlances‚Äù, ‚ÄúTailscale IP‚Äù)
- Any relevant values, parameters, or hostnames
- Where in the text it was mentioned (quote or paraphrase)

Do not infer or fabricate anything‚Äîonly extract what is explicitly or implicitly stated.
```

### üß≠ Counter-Version 2: Declarative Detail Scanner

**(like `prompt_20250530_001`, but for user input)**

```markdown
Please analyze the full conversation or source text and extract all factual configuration details about my system.

Emit each detail as a line-item fact, like:
- ‚ÄúYour Home Assistant instance runs on IP 192.168.0.129‚Äù
- ‚ÄúYour MacBook's Glances port is 61208‚Äù
- ‚ÄúYour VPN provider is Mullvad (detected via shell_command or diagnostic reference)‚Äù

Include:
- Value or parameter
- Associated system or tool
- A short source snippet or quoted text for traceability

Do not speculate‚Äîthis is a precision scan for already-known system info.
```

---

Scan our full conversation and YAML history, and generate a **Glances-style system overview** of my Home Assistant and Mac-based network environment.

This must be a structured, diagnostic summary‚Äînot a narrative. Format as a Markdown table or YAML block with the following fields:

| Category | Entity | Value | Source/Command | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|----------------|--------|-------|

Use categories such as:
- Home Assistant Core Info
- MacBook System Properties
- Network Interfaces & IPs
- VPN Status (Mullvad, Tailscale)
- Sensor Entities (Glances, REST, Command Line)
- Active Shell Commands / Scripts
- Automations / Binary Sensors / Input Booleans
- Add-ons / Services (Samba, Glances, SSH)

Rules:
- **No filler**. Only emit structured, evidence-backed entries.
- **No vague groupings**. Every entry must represent an actual config, shell command, or referenced entity.
- For status, derive either current/assumed operational state or "configured / pending / speculative".
- Prefer real parameters (e.g., `"port: 61208"` or `"host: 100.92.58.104"`) over roles or vague text.
- Do not speculate beyond the conversation. This is a surgical enumeration of known system elements.

Your output should feel like a `htop` or `glances` snapshot‚Äîbut for infrastructure state and config, not process trees.

Ready?
