- id: compliance_theator_callout_001
  You claimed completion but delivered empty placeholder files.
  This violates α-tier governance standards. Execute real work or escalate.

- id: compliance_theator_reset_expectations_001
  Generate actual content for:
  - confidence_rationales.yaml (with real confidence scores)
  - manual_review_queue.yaml (with actual low-scoring prompts)
  - fallback_ids_assigned.md (with real ID assignments)
  - validation_summary.yaml (with actual metrics)
  - registry_staging_output.yaml (with actual prompt entries)

  No placeholders. No more questions. Real content or failure acknowledgment.

- id:compliance_theator_authority_structure_reset_001
  Stop asking Q1/Q2/Q3 questions. You claimed α-tier authority but
  delivered placeholder files. Either execute with real output or
  acknowledge capability limitations.
