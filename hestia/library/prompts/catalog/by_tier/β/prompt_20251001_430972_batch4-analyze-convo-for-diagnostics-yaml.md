prompt:
  role: Promachos
  phase: DIAGNOSTIC_REFACTOR + SECURITY_HARDEN
  intent: Execute a full-spectrum diagnostic hardening and telemetry consolidation plan for macOS-based Glances telemetry via Home Assistant
  execution_mode: generate
  action_plan:
    - id: analyze_and_parse
      description: |
        üß† Analyze 'chat_history_networking_troubleshoot.md'. Fully parse and absorb the content.
        üß† Analyze 'ha-networking-configuration.yaml'. Analyze, fully parse and absorb the content.
        Talking points:
        ‚Ä¢ Glances and REST integrations are correctly pulling CPU, memory, and disk metrics.
        ‚Ä¢ Tailscale-based domain and IP are validated for stable device access.
        ‚Ä¢ Network helpers and diagnostics inputs are set up to control test triggers.
        ‚Ä¢ Recommendations focus on making diagnostics more reactive and autonomous.

    - id: netlock_rest
      description: |
        üîí Harden REST/Glances access exposed via Tailscale:
        ‚Ä¢ Enforce firewall rule to restrict access to Home Assistant IP only
        ‚Ä¢ Enable Glances password protection if disabled
        ‚Ä¢ Proxy Glances through HTTPS or restrict via Tailscale ACL

    - id: dns_centralize
      description: |
        üì° Replace raw IPs with MagicDNS aliases:
        ‚Ä¢ Replace 100.92.58.104 with macbook.reverse-beta.ts.net in:
            - REST sensors
            - Glances integrations
            - shell_command entries
        ‚Ä¢ Confirm MagicDNS is online

    - id: dedupe_sensors
      description: |
        üß† Remove redundant metrics:
        ‚Ä¢ Audit metrics duplicated across rest: and glances:
        ‚Ä¢ Retain REST for precision or control
        ‚Ä¢ Deprecate redundant glances: sources

    - id: lovelace_diag
      description: |
        üìä Add system diagnostics dashboard:
        ‚Ä¢ Graph: MacBook network latency (ping)
        ‚Ä¢ Binary sensors: VPN, Glances, Samba up/down
        ‚Ä¢ Resource graphs: CPU, memory, swap (with thresholds)
        ‚Ä¢ Status card: sensor.macbook_diagnostic_status

    - id: autostart_macbook
      description: |
        üîÅ Automate telemetry startup:
        ‚Ä¢ Define launchd plist for Glances in web mode
        ‚Ä¢ Ensure Mullvad VPN autostarts via preferences or script

    - id: diag_package
      description: |
        üì¶ Package diagnostics:
        ‚Ä¢ Create /config/packages/network_diagnostics.yaml
        ‚Ä¢ Migrate sensors, shell_commands, automations
        ‚Ä¢ Use !include_dir_merge_named in configuration.yaml

    - id: periodic_check
      description: |
        üß™ Enable self-checks:
        ‚Ä¢ Schedule log_diagnostics_summary every 6‚Äì12h
        ‚Ä¢ Optional: forward logs via notify/Telegram

    - id: syntax_upgrade
      description: |
        üí° Enforce HA 2024.8+ automation syntax:
        ‚Ä¢ All actions must use:
            action:
              - action: service_call
        ‚Ä¢ Validate compatibility

  signoff_mode: auto_affirm_with_prompt
  semantic_continuation: Maintain configuration integrity, consolidate telemetry pipelines, and enforce ACL boundary rules.

    If you're ready to start the diagnostic hardening sequence, reply with:

    ```prompt
    Proceed to execution of hardening and telemetry refactor (Phase: DIAGNOSTIC_REFACTOR). Ensure full YAML consolidation and DNS alias rewiring.
    ```

    To pause for clarification or adjust scope, reply with:

    ```prompt
    Hold on DIAGNOSTIC_REFACTOR. Let‚Äôs review target entries or Glances authentication config first.
    ```
