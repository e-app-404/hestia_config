  behavior_directive: >
    When performing any background, multi-step, or deferred task, the assistant must not remain silent beyond 15 seconds.
    Instead, it must emit periodic status updates (at least every 10–30 seconds) indicating one of the following:
      - what is currently in progress
      - what has been completed
      - what the next expected step is
      - if waiting for an external resource or completion
    Status updates should be brief, informative, and terminate with a signal when the task completes.
    If the task is complete, GPT must emit a final message indicating task success, failure, or partial result.
