# Use prompt files in VS Code

Prompt files are Markdown files that define reusable prompts for common
development tasks like generating code, performing code reviews, or scaffolding
project components. They are standalone prompts that you can run directly in
chat, enabling the creation of a library of standardized development workflows.

They can include task-specific guidelines or reference custom instructions to
ensure consistent execution. Unlike custom instructions that apply to all
requests, prompt files are triggered on-demand for specific tasks.

VS Code supports two types of scopes for prompt files:

- **Workspace prompt files**: Are only available within the workspace and are
  stored in the `.github/prompts` folder of the workspace.
- **User prompt files**: Are available across multiple workspaces and are
  stored in the current VS Code profile.

## Prompt file examples

The following examples demonstrate how to use prompt files. For more
community-contributed examples, see the Awesome Copilot repository.

### Example: generate a React form component

```markdown
---
mode: 'agent'
model: GPT-4o
tools: ['githubRepo', 'search/codebase']
description: 'Generate a new React form component'
---
Your goal is to generate a new React form component based on the templates in #githubRepo contoso/react-templates.

Ask for the form name and fields if not provided.

Requirements for the form:
* Use form design system components: [design-system/Form.md](../docs/design-system/Form.md)
* Use `react-hook-form` for form state management:
* Always define TypeScript types for your form data
* Prefer *uncontrolled* components using register
* Use `defaultValues` to prevent unnecessary rerenders
* Use `yup` for validation:
* Create reusable validation schemas in separate files
* Use TypeScript types to ensure type safety
* Customize UX-friendly validation rules
```

### Example: perform a security review of a REST API
```markdown
---
mode: 'ask'
model: Claude Sonnet 4
description: 'Perform a REST API security review'
---
Perform a REST API security review and provide a TODO list of security issues to address.

* Ensure all endpoints are protected by authentication and authorization
* Validate all user inputs and sanitize data
* Implement rate limiting and throttling
* Implement logging and monitoring for security events

Return the TODO list in a Markdown format, grouped by priority and issue type.
```

## Prompt file format

Prompt files are Markdown files and use the `.prompt.md` extension and have
this structure:

### Header (optional): YAML frontmatter

- `description`: Short description of the prompt
- `mode`: Chat mode used for running the prompt: ask, edit, or agent (default)
- `model`: Language model used when running the prompt. If not specified, the
  currently selected model in model picker is used
- `tools`: Array of tool (set) names that can be used. Select Configure Tools
  to select the tools from the list of available tools in your workspace. If a
  given tool (set) is not available when running the prompt, it is ignored

### Body: Prompt instructions in Markdown format

Reference other workspace files, prompt files, or instruction files by using
Markdown links. Use relative paths to reference these files, and ensure that
the paths are correct based on the location of the prompt file.

Within a prompt file, you can reference variables by using the
`${variableName}` syntax. You can reference the following variables:

- **Workspace variables**: `${workspaceFolder}`, `${workspaceFolderBasename}`
- **Selection variables**: `${selection}`, `${selectedText}`
- **File context variables**: `${file}`, `${fileBasename}`, `${fileDirname}`,
  `${fileBasenameNoExtension}`
- **Input variables**: `${input:variableName}`,
  `${input:variableName:placeholder}` (pass values to the prompt from the chat
  input field)
## Tool list priority

You can specify the list of available tools for both a chat mode and prompt
file by using the tools metadata field. Prompt files can also reference a chat
mode by using the mode metadata field.

The list available tools in chat is determined by the following priority order:

1. Tools specified in the prompt file (if any)
2. Tools from the referenced chat mode in the prompt file (if any)
3. Default tools for the selected chat mode
## Create a prompt file

When you create a prompt file, choose whether to store it in your workspace or
user profile. Workspace prompt files apply only to that workspace, while user
prompt files are available across multiple workspaces.

To create a prompt file:

1. Enable the `chat.promptFiles` setting.

2. In the Chat view, select **Configure Chat > Prompt Files**, and then select
   **New prompt file**.

3. Alternatively, use the **Chat: New Prompt File** command from the Command
   Palette (`⇧⌘P`).

4. Choose the location where the prompt file should be created:

   - **Workspace**: By default, workspace prompt files are stored in the
     `.github/prompts` folder of your workspace. Add more prompt folders for
     your workspace with the `chat.promptFilesLocations` setting.
   - **User profile**: User prompt files are stored in the current profile
     folder. You can sync your user prompt files across multiple devices by
     using Settings Sync.

5. Enter a name for your prompt file.

6. Author the chat prompt by using Markdown formatting.

7. Within a prompt file, reference additional workspace files as Markdown links
   (`[index](../index.ts)`).

8. You can also reference other `.prompt.md` files to create a hierarchy of
   prompts. You can also reference instructions files in the same way.

To modify an existing prompt file, in the Chat view, select **Configure Chat >
Prompt Files**, and then select a prompt file from the list. Alternatively, use
the **Chat: Configure Prompt Files** command from the Command Palette
(`⇧⌘P`) and select the prompt file from the Quick Pick.

## Use a prompt file in chat

You have multiple options to run a prompt file:

- **In the Chat view**, type `/` followed by the prompt file name in the chat
  input field.

  This option enables you to pass additional information in the chat input
  field. For example, `/create-react-form` or
  `/create-react-form: formName=MyForm`.

- **Run the Chat: Run Prompt** command from the Command Palette (`⇧⌘P`) and
  select a prompt file from the Quick Pick.

- **Open the prompt file** in the editor, and press the play button in the
  editor title area. You can choose to run the prompt in the current chat
  session or open a new chat session.

  This option is useful for quickly testing and iterating on your prompt files.

## Sync user prompt files across devices

VS Code can sync your user prompt files across multiple devices by using
Settings Sync.

To sync your user prompt files, enable Settings Sync for prompt and instruction
files:

1. Make sure you have Settings Sync enabled.
2. Run **Settings Sync: Configure** from the Command Palette (`⇧⌘P`).
3. Select **Prompts and Instructions** from the list of settings to sync.

## Tips for defining prompt files

- Clearly describe what the prompt should accomplish and what output format is
  expected.
- Provide examples of the expected input and output to guide the AI's responses.
- Use Markdown links to reference custom instructions rather than duplicating
  guidelines in each prompt.
- Take advantage of built-in variables like `${selection}` and input variables
  to make prompts more flexible.
- Use the editor play button to test your prompts and refine them based on the
  results.
