# Automation conditions

Conditions are an optional part of an automation rule. They can be used to prevent the automation's actions from being run. After a {% term trigger %} occurred, all conditions will be checked. The automation will be executed if all conditions return `true`. If any of the conditions returns `false`, the automation won't start.

Conditions look very similar to triggers, but they are very different â€” a trigger will look at events happening in the system, while a condition only looks at how the system looks right now. A trigger can observe that a switch is being turned on. A condition can only see if a switch is currently on or off.

The available conditions for an automation are the same as for the script syntax so see that page for a [full list of available conditions](/docs/scripts/conditions/).

Example of using condition:

```yaml
- alias: "Turn on office lights"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.office_motion_sensor
      to: "on"
  condition:
    - or:
        - condition: numeric_state
          entity_id: sun.sun
          attribute: elevation
          below: 4
        - condition: numeric_state
          entity_id: sensor.office_lux_sensor
          below: 10
  action:
    - service: scene.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: scene.office_lights
```

The `condition` option of an automation also accepts a single condition template directly. For example:

```yaml
- alias: "Turn on office lights"
  trigger:
    - platform: state
      entity_id: sensor.office_motion_sensor
      to: "on"
  condition: "{{ state_attr('sun.sun', 'elevation') < 4 }}"
  action:
    - service: scene.turn_on
      target:
        entity_id: scene.office_lights
```
