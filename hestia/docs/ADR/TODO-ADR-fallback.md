Fallback log path ADR

The ADR proposing `/Users/evertappels/Projects/HomeAssistant/logs` as a last-resort local log path has been created in `/tmp/adr_fallback_logpath.md`. Move or copy this file to your repository ADR directory (for example `docs/adr/`) when file access to the repo is available.

Commands to move into repo once mount is healthy:

sudo mkdir -p /n/ha/path/to/repo/docs/adr
sudo mv /tmp/adr_fallback_logpath.md /n/ha/path/to/repo/docs/adr/XXX-fallback-logpath.md

Title: ADR XXX â€” Fallback local log path for Home Assistant tooling
Date: 2025-09-22
Status: Proposed

Context

The Home Assistant configuration workspace is normally mounted from network storage (the NAS) at `/n/ha` or `/Volumes/ha`. In the event of network mount failures, automount placeholders (auto_smb) or lock issues, the tooling that writes logs or temporary operational files may be unable to persist data to the canonical config path. This causes diagnostic gaps and impedes incident response.

Decision

When the primary Home Assistant config mount (the operator's `root config` mount) is unavailable, tooling and scripts MUST write fallback logs to the operator's local directory:

/Users/evertappels/Projects/HomeAssistant/logs

This location is to be used only as a last-resort fallback when the canonical logging or config locations are unreachable.

Rationale

- Local storage in the operator's home directory ensures logs survive network outages and are available for diagnostics.
- Using a consistent fallback path across tooling simplifies developer expectations and automation for collection.
- The path is operator-specific and reduces risk of accidentally placing logs on other systems.

Consequences

- Scripts must detect mount readiness (e.g., verify `/n/ha` or configured `root config` path is mounted and writable) before writing to canonical locations; otherwise they should write to the fallback path.
- The fallback path is not a replacement for central persistent logging; teams must still ensure logs are copied to central storage or attached to incident reports.
- Access control and rotation must be implemented for the fallback path if it is used in production for extended durations.

Implementation

- Add helper `ensure_log_path()` used by scripts which:
  - verifies primary mount is writable; if not, ensures the fallback directory exists with 0700 permissions and returns its path.

- Update `ha_autofs_hardened.sh` to write logs to `/var/log/ha_autofs_hardened.log` when possible, but fall back to `/Users/evertappels/Projects/HomeAssistant/logs/ha_autofs_hardened.log` if the mount is unavailable or unwritable.

Follow-ups

- Confirm canonical `root config` path once mounting issue is resolved and update ADR accordingly.
- Add retention/rotation policy for fallback logs in operations runbook.
- Review any tooling that currently writes to `/tmp` or other ephemeral locations and update to use `ensure_log_path()`.
