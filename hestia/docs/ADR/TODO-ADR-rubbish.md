Pending configuration:

ADR to define and channel how to manage files flagged depreated, trash, archived, bundles, tarball, etc.

Need to define:
- Classify and canonicalize folders where specific types of files go (e.g. hestia/vault, root trash/ folder, etc)
- Define automated workspace actions based on file type / extension / location / timestamp
